**You can't act on a vague goal.**

Be specific on what you want.

When you don't know the next step, you feel lost and procrastinate.

- Write down everything you know. Include every detail and your philosophy.
- Break details into specific ingredients.
- Research what you don't know.
- Turn your findings into actions.
