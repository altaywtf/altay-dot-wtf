Defining some restrictions before you do something may make the process more joyful.

I have attended [Global Day of Coderetreat](https://www.coderetreat.org) in 2019, we were coding Game of Life in short sessions with different pairs and restrictions on each. We couldn't finish the implementation, but it was quite nice.
