Just do whatever Shopify does.

I'm astonished by the swiftness of their checkout experience.\
It's so effortless that makes me worry about something went wrong.

One click, a fingerprint scan, done. Didn't need to type anything. Everything with one hand.

It's as good as the _I don't need to take my wallet off_ solution for coffee shops mentioned in [The Best Interface Is No Interface](../books/the-best-interface-is-no-interface).
