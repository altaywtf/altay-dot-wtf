Users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

- Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar.
- Leveraging existing mental models would help us to create superior experiences that would flatten the learning curve of our service.
- When introducing re-designs, prefer gradual transitions between the versions. Allow people to keep using the old version so they can try and adapt without completely leaving the product.
