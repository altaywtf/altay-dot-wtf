The third chapter of [Everything is Fucked](../books/everything-is-fucked) paints Isaac Newton –who had a lonely and loveless childhood– as the explorer of our inner world. He comes up with three laws of emotion based on his experiences.

#### For every action, there is an equal and opposite emotional reaction.

Our experiences create moral gaps. It leads us to think that we don't deserve what just happened to us. Both positive and negative.

Our Feeling Brain acts toward the experiences that relieve pain hence they are more desirable.

#### Our self-worth equals the sum of our emotions over time.

When moral gaps persist for a long enough time, they normalize. We surrender and undervalue ourselves as _the_ creep who deserves everything.

The opposite applies, and both are narcissistic because it's based on the expectation of a _special treatment_.

#### Our identity will stay our identity until a new experience acts against it.

When our Feeling Brain feels something, our Thinking Brain constructs are narrative to explain it. Those narratives stick with us and define us, unless we have experiences that shows the opposite.

The only way to change our [values](./values) is to have experiences _contrary_ to our values.

This is why there's no such thing as change without pain, no growth without discomfort.
