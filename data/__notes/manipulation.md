The definition of manipulation, according to Seth Godin. (which I totally agree with.)

If people know what you already know &mdash;about your product, your service, and your methods&mdash; would they still be eager to buy from you? (or vote for you ðŸ™‚)

If we use leverage and pressure to get someone to make a short-term decision that they will regret in the long run, we've manipulated them.

No regrets, no manipulation.
