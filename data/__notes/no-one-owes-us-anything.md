We have two obligations while doing creative work.

### Our obligation to community

People who fed, taught, connected, and believed us. We need to break our shell, trust ourselves to create work to move that community forward.

### No one has an obligation towards us

They don't owe us an applause, money, or thanks. If we choose to do work for generous reasons, we'll choose self-trust over never-ending search for validation and [the perfect outcome](./process).
