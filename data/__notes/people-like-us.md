Almost everything we do is to make change happen.

Most of the times, that change is triggered by a desire to fit in.

- "People like me own a car."
- "People like me don't cheat on taxes."
- "People like me eat organic."

Even if you are trying to be an outlier, you are following another outlier.

**There is no universal culture**. You must pick the audience and ignore everyone else. Focus on building a living story that resonates with their culture.
