Permission marketing is the privilege of people who would miss you if you were gone.

It's like dating. You earn trust by showing up, and building a confidence message by message.

In order to get that permission, you need to make a promise.

Using facebook or alternatives are not good enough for permission marketing, since they own the real estate. Newsletters and blogs work better in that sense.

Once you earn the permission, you can educate. Take your time and [tell your story.](./telling-stories.md)
