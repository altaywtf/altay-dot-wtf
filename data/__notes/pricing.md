When you are the cheapest, you are not [promising change](./tension-and-forward-motion.md).

You are promising the same, but cheaper.

### Why not make everything free?

Engagement of a transaction removes the feeling of "worthless".

You need cash flow to improve the service.

Use free ideas that spread to raise awareness -> Akimbo podcast.

Build expensive expressions of those ideas that worth paying for -> altMBA.

It doesn't mean they are bad, rather more welcoming.
