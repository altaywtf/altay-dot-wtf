Sometimes the Feeling Brain takes careless actions based on emotions and Thinking Brain doesn’t contradict too much because it wants to live. If they can’t get along it leads to a bigger problem that could end up in a total destruction. So the Thinking Brain justifies bad decisions of the feeling brain, thus we don’t feel bad.

_I deserve an ice-cream_ because _I worked hard today_.
