[Simple questions](./simple-questions.md) have painful answers, and this one above is a gem. I don't recall where I heard it for the first time. I can see the reflections in almost everything I read. It instills a never-ending skepticism. Suddenly there is an infinite-scrolling to-do list.

I keen on repeatedly asking those [simple questions](./simple-questions.md) to myself. They create tension. Sometimes too much. [The only way to relieve this tension is to trigger a forward motion.](./tension-and-forward-motion) Otherwise, they eat me alive. ðŸ‘¹

Speaking of being eaten alive, [the vampire test](./the-vampire-test.md) is a great way for eliminating things that we can't have a meaningful explanation.

Taking a step back and thinking about [how do we decide what to do](./two-types-of-decisions.md) and [what are our values](./values.md) are accurate places to trigger questioning.

Sometimes we find ourselves in messy situations that feels like we lost the control. How is that even possible? What we don't know is that [self-control is an illusion.](./self-control.md)
