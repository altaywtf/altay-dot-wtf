## Book 1: Introduction

### Interventionistas

Politicans and people like them, who talks a lot and doesn’t really affected by their actions. Their three flaws:

- they think in statics not dynamics,
- they think in low, not high, dimensions,
- they think in terms of actions, never interactions.

We saw that interventionistas don’t learn because they are not the victims of their mistakes.

### Systems Learn by Removing

- You will never fully convince someone that he is wrong; only reality can.
- **Reality doesn’t care about winning arguments, survival is what matters.**
- The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining than understanding.

### Silver Beats Gold

- The Golden Rule wants you to Treat others the way you would like them to treat you.
- The more robust Silver Rule says Do not treat others the way you would not like them to treat you.
- First, it tells you to mind your own business and not decide what is “good” for others. We know with much more clarity what is bad than what is good.
- There is a difference between a charlatan and a genuinely skilled member of society, say that between a macrobullshitter political “scientist” and a plumber, or between a journalist and a mafia made man. The doer wins by doing, not convincing.

### Soul in the Game

Honor implies that there are some actions you would categorically never do, regardless of the material rewards.

## Book 2: A First Look at Agency

There are two types of “talking one’s book.” One consists of buying a stock because you like it, then commenting on it (and disclosing such ownership)—the most reliable advocate for a product is its user.fn6 Another is buying a stock so you can advertise the qualities of the company, then selling it, benefiting from the trumpeting—this is called market manipulation, and it is certainly a conflict of interest.

## Book 3: That Greatest Asymmetry

- Minorities can affect majority!
- You start eating vegan and your family eats vegan then local markets start selling vegan and suddenly we are all vegan.
- But some of the flexible voters can also vote for that extreme faction, just as non-kosher people can eat kosher.
- The market is like a large movie theater with a small door. and the best way to detect a sucker is to see if his focus is on the size of the theater rather than that of the door.

## Book 4: Wolves Among Dogs

### How to Legally Own Another Person

- Freelance pilot story, you are planning a trip to Bavaria from somewhere for october fest but your pilot gets another offer and sells you out.
- Lovers of paychecks are lazy, but they would never let you down at times like these.
- The best slave is someone you overpay and who knows it, terrified of losing his status.

### The Skin of Others in Your Game

Intellectual and ethical freedom requires the absence of the skin of others in one’s game, which is why the free are so rare. I cannot possibly imagine the activist Ralph Nader, when he was the target of large motor companies, raising a family with 2 kids and a dog.

## Book 5: Being Alive Means Taking Risks

### The Intellectual Yet Idiot

- The IYI pathologies others for doing things he doesn’t understand without ever realizing it is his understanding that may be limited.
- The IYI subscribes to The New Yorker, a journal designed so philistines can learn to fake a conversation about evolution, neurosomething, cognitive biases, and quantum mechanics.

### Inequality

Aristotle, in his Rhetoric, postulated that envy is something you are more likely to encounter in your own kin: lower classes are more likely to experience envy toward their cousins or the middle class than toward the very rich. And the expression Nobody is a prophet in his own land, making envy a geographical thing (mistakenly thought to originate with Jesus), originates from that passage in the Rhetoric. Aristotle himself was building on Hesiod: cobbler envies cobbler, carpenter envies carpenter. Later, Jean de La Bruyère wrote that jealousy is to be found within the same art, talent, and condition.

## Book 6: Deeper into Agency

- **Surgeons Should Not Look Like Surgeons:** Good looking surgeon vs butcher.
- People can only be social friends if they don’t try to upstage or outsmart one another.
