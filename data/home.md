I'm a software engineer building user interfaces for web, mobile, and streaming devices. I'm quite passionate about TypeScript, React ecosystem, developer experience, and monorepos.

I'm currently based in Bodrum and mostly working on [putio](https://put.io), a cloud storage service that helps you to download and stream files, also a couple of passion projects on the side.

Before moving to Bodrum, I spent three years in Berlin to work on [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app and [Lisk](https://lisk.io)'s mobile cryptocurrency wallet.

Prior to Berlin, I lived in Istanbul where I studied Mechanical Engineering at Istanbul Bilgi University, cut my teeth at several internships, and eventually joined [putio](https://put.io) in 2017.
