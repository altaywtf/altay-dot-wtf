I'm a software engineer passionate about frontend infrastructure, monorepos, and developer experience. 

I'm currently working remotely as a contractor, mostly focusing on those areas.

Before that, I lived in Berlin for three years, where I worked on [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app and [Lisk](https://lisk.com)'s open-source mobile cryptocurrency wallet.

Prior to Berlin, I was in Istanbul, where I studied Mechanical Engineering at Istanbul Bilgi University, cut my teeth at several internships, and joined [putio](https://put.io) back in 2017.
