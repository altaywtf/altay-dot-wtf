I'm a software developer living in _Bodrum_ and working on [putio](https://put.io)'s user-facing parts.

Before _Bodrum_, I lived in _Berlin_ for three years and worked on [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app, and the mobile wallet of [Lisk](https://lisk.io).

Before _Berlin_, I lived in _Istanbul_ where I studied university, done several internships, and eventually joined [putio](https://put.io).

Thanks for visiting my website!
