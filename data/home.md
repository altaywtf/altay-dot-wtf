I'm a software engineer building user interfaces for web, mobile, and streaming devices.

I'm currently based in Bodrum and working at [putio](https://put.io), which I've been a part of since 2017.

Before moving to Bodrum, I spent three years in Berlin to work on [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app and [Lisk](https://lisk.io)'s mobile cryptocurrency wallet.

Prior to Berlin, I lived in Istanbul where I studied Mechanical Engineering at Istanbul Bilgi University, cut my teeth at several gigs, and eventually joined [putio](https://put.io).
