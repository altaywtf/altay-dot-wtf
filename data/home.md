I'm a software engineer mostly focused on the user-facing side of digital products.

I'm currently living in Berlin, building media streaming apps for [putio](https://put.io), and working on some [passion projects](/projects) on the side.

During the past several years, I also worked at [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app ecosystem and a blockchain startup called [Lisk.](https://lisk.io)

Thanks for visiting my website!
