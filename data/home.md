I'm a software engineer mostly focused on the user-facing side of digital products.

During the past several years, I worked at [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app ecosystem and a blockchain startup called [Lisk](https://lisk.io) in Berlin.

Before moving to Berlin, I lived in Istanbul and built cross-platform media streaming apps for [putio](https://put.io).

Thanks for visiting my website!
