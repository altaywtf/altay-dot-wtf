I'm a software developer who likes to design and build user-interfaces.

I'm currently living in Bodrum and building cloud storage + media streaming apps for [putio](https://put.io).

Before Bodrum, I lived in Berlin for three years and worked on the frontend architecture of [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app, and the mobile crypto wallet of [Lisk](https://lisk.io).

Before Berlin, I lived in Istanbul where I studied university, done several internships, and eventually joined [putio](https://put.io).

Thanks for visiting my website!
