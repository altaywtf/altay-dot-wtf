I'm a software engineer building apps for web, mobile, smart TVs, and streaming devices. I'm passionate about TypeScript, React ecosystem, state machines, monorepos, and developer experience.

I'm currently based in Bodrum and mostly working on [putio](https://put.io), a cloud storage service that helps you to download files from various sources and stream from anywhere you want.

Before moving to Bodrum, I lived three years in Berlin to work on [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app and [Lisk](https://lisk.io)'s open-source mobile cryptocurrency wallet.

Prior to Berlin, I was in Istanbul where I studied Mechanical Engineering at Istanbul Bilgi University, cut my teeth at several internships, and eventually joined [putio](https://put.io) back in 2017.
