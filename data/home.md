I'm a software engineer building apps for web, mobile, and streaming devices.

I'm currently working on [putio](https://put.io)'s user-facing parts.

In the past, I lived in Berlin for three years and worked on [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app, and the mobile wallet of [Lisk](https://lisk.io).

Before Berlin, I lived in Istanbul where I studied Mechanical Engineering in Istanbul Bilgi University, done several internships, and eventually joined [putio](https://put.io).

Thanks for visiting my website!
