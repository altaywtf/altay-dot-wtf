I'm a software engineer mostly focused on the user-facing side of digital products.

I'm currently living in Berlin, taking a break from work and planning what to do next.

During the past several years, I worked at [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app ecosystem and a blockchain startup called [Lisk.](https://lisk.io)

Before moving to Berlin, I lived in Istanbul and built cross-platform media streaming apps for [putio](https://put.io), which I'm still a part of.

Thanks for visiting my website!
