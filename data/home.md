I'm a software engineer building apps for web, mobile, and streaming devices.

I'm currently based in Bodrum and working on [putio](https://put.io)'s user-facing parts.

Before moving to Bodrum, I lived in Berlin and worked on [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app, and the mobile wallet of [Lisk](https://lisk.io).

Even before, I studied Mechanical Engineering at Istanbul Bilgi University, cut my teeth at several internships, and eventually joined [putio](https://put.io).

Thanks for visiting my website!
