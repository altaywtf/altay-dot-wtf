I like computers, books, coffee, and building things that are solving problems I empathize with.

I'm currently living in Berlin, working at [Amie](https://amie.so) as a product engineer, and spending time on some [passion projects](/projects) on the side.

During the past few years, I worked at several teams in [Klarna](https://klarna.com) consumer app ecosystem and a blockchain startup called [Lisk](https://lisk.io).

Before moving to Berlin, I lived in Istanbul and built web, iOS, tvOS, Roku, Chromecast, and Smart TV apps for [put.io](https://put.io), which I'm still a part of.

Thanks for visiting my website!
