Iâ€™m a software engineer passionate about the React ecosystem, monorepos, and enhancing developer experience.

Currently, I work remotely as a contractor, mostly on projects that center on these areas.

Before that, I spent three years in Berlin, where I worked on [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app and contributed to [Lisk](https://lisk.com)'s open-source mobile cryptocurrency wallet.

Prior to Berlin, I was in Istanbul, where I studied Mechanical Engineering at Istanbul Bilgi University, cut my teeth at several internships, and joined [putio](https://put.io) back in 2017.
