I'm a software engineer building apps for web, mobile, smart TVs, and streaming devices. I'm quite passionate about React ecosystem, monorepos, and developer experience.

I'm currently based in Bodrum and providing services as a contractor for various companies.

Before moving to Bodrum, I lived three years in Berlin to work on [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app and [Lisk](https://lisk.io)'s open-source mobile cryptocurrency wallet.

Prior to Berlin, I was in Istanbul where I studied Mechanical Engineering at Istanbul Bilgi University, cut my teeth at several internships, and eventually joined [putio](https://put.io) back in 2017.
