I'm a software engineer mainly focused on the user-facing side of digital products. I currently live in Berlin and spend most of my time with computers, books, coffee, and video games.

During the past few years, I worked at several teams in [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app ecosystem and a blockchain startup called [Lisk](https://lisk.io).

Before moving to Berlin, I lived in Istanbul and built multi-platform media streaming apps for [put.io](https://put.io), which I'm eternally a part of.

Thanks for visiting my website!
