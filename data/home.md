I'm a software engineer who likes to build user-interfaces.

During the past three years, I lived in Berlin and worked at [Klarna](https://klarna.com)'s consumer app ecosystem, also a blockchain startup called [Lisk](https://lisk.io).

Before moving to Berlin, I lived in Istanbul and built cross-platform media streaming apps for [put.io](https://put.io), which I'm still working on nowadays.

Thanks for visiting my website!
