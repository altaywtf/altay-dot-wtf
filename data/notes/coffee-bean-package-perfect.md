This is _Ethiopia Koromii_ from [Oslo Kaffebar](https://www.instagram.com/oslokaffebar/). It has a peachy flavor and my favorite in all aspects.

The package is convenient to use even I'm running low on beans.
It's easy to expand the bag to dip the spoon in.

Black feels premium, and the colorful cover on top adds a joy.
That orange circle reminds me of its taste.

They are giving a one cup of coffee for free when you buy beans.
Profit. ðŸ˜‰
