I haven't been updating here for a while. Aside from the self-indulgent reasons (lots of gaming and slacking off), I had to fix some unpleasant things in life (work, apartment, etc.) to get back on track.

Now that I can feel my brain again, I wanted to restructure the content I have here as well. So I combined the digital garden notes with the blog posts because eventually, everything I put here is a note. Sometimes just an excerpt from something I read, sometimes my thoughts.

The mental overhead of writing a blog post is too high. Maybe it should be. However, I just want to keep the things I find interesting for the sake of helping myself or, who knows, maybe you too.
