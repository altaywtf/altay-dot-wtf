Directly influenced by [Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsgAsw4XGvU), in [Everything is Fucked](../books-everything-is-fucked.md) Mark Manson discusses:

Consciousness is what distinguishes humans from other living creatures.

Our conscious helps us to understand the nature, overcome complexities, and create even more complex systems.

The most fundamental moral duty for every _mature_ human being should be the preservation and growth of the collective conscious.

> Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, by no other means.
>
> â€“ Immanuel Kant

Unlike any other moral systems or codes, the formula of humanity does not rely on hope.

- The only logical way to improve the world is through improving ourselves by growing up and being more virtuous.
- Your ability to be honest, respectful, caring against yourself will also improve how you interact with others and influence them to do the same.
- Dignity and respect over all religions: don't manipulate, treat, enslave people just because you'll gain something at the end.
