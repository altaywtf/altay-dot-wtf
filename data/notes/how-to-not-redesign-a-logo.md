Google's new app icons for GSuite look pretty bad.
Because they are almost indistinguishable from each other.

Apparently they wanted to use all its colors on every icon.
That might be a legit idea for the brand consistency.
But if you have all the GSuite apps in the same screen, good luck with your astigmatism.

I wonder how they evaluated the accessibility aspect.

Microsoft uses a distinct color for all the office apps, so you can tell the difference with no hustle.

Putting a frame into a frame is another aesthetic problem.
All the app icons are already appearing as frames in the screen.
