### ðŸ˜´

Well, nowadays I'm not as _productive_ as the [past several months.](/now/history)

### ðŸŽ®

I recently built a PC for gaming.

I've been playing Portal series, Overwatch, FIFA 21 (quite a lot), and Valheim with my friends.

### ðŸšš

Apart from that, I signed a contract for my first flat in Berlin, after living in a furnished agency flat for 2.5 years.

Exciting and exhausting times ahead.
