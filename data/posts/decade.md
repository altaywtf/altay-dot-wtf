title: 'Great software is composed; not written'
oneliner: A collection of thoughts from the past decade.

A collection of principles to weave into a cohesive post, drawing from the [wisdom of wizards](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html), modern practices, and my first decade as a software engineer.

### Composition is the foundation
- Systems built from composable parts are easier to understand, test, and maintain; also use.
- Each piece should have a clear purpose and work seamlessly with others.
- Composition applies to all layers: types, components, hooks, middleware, schemas, APIs.

### Abstraction is the way
- Abstraction reduces complexity and enhances maintainability.
- Clear boundaries between layers allow systems to scale without chaos.
- Documentation is your best friend for planning, understanding, and using abstractions.

### Types are the ultimate contract
- Types are a developer's safety net, a way to communicate intent and enforce correctness.
- Strongly typed systems provide confidence and improve velocity.
- There's no better feeling than knowing [why are you doing what you are doing](./why.md)

### Declarative over imperative
- Declarative systems are easier to reason about and maintain.
- "What" matters more than "how" â€” from UI (React) to data fetching (GraphQL/RPC).
- Being more declarative empowers the "flow state".

### Simplicity is strength
- Simplicity makes code readable, maintainable, and robust.
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness; solutions should feel intuitive and elegant.
- Accidental complexity hides bugs and slows everyone down.
  
### Pragmatism over perfection
- ["Great software today is often preferable to the perfect software tomorrow."](../books/the-pragmatic-programmer.md#5-good-enough-software)
- Build for today, design for tomorrow.
- Learn to recognize when to optimize and when to ship.

### Iteration and validation
- Nothing is great on the first pass - iteration is a given.
- Testing is non-negotiable - it validates assumptions and builds confidence.
- Use what you gonna build, build what you gonna use.

### Developer experience as a priority
- Best systems are a joy to work with.
- Codebase, tooling, documentation, and your cause should empower, not hinder.
- Be a boy scout, leave the place you touch better than you found.

### People are your best asset (including yourself)
- Collectives are _usually_ stronger than individuals.
- Find your tribe, take care of them - grow together.
- Praise in public, criticize in private.
- And please; **be nice first, be right later.**

Well, that's it.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to work with amazing people and build stuff that helped amazing people.

Looking forward to many more years of learning, building, and shipping.

Thanks for reading.
