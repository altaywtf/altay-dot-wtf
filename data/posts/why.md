[Simple questions](../books/choose-yourself) have painful answers, and this one above is a gem. I don't recall where I heard it for the first time. I can see the reflections in almost everything I read. It instills a never-ending skepticism. Suddenly there is an infinite-scrolling to-do list.

I keen on repeatedly asking those simple questions to myself. They create tension. Sometimes too much. The only way to relieve this tension is to trigger a forward motion. Otherwise, they eat me alive. 👹

Speaking of being eaten alive, the vampire test is a great way for eliminating things that we can't have a meaningful explanation.

> Whatever drains you, stop doing it.
