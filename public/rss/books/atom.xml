        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are all bored and everything is boring. Occupied 24/7, doing nothing at all.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like the path of evolution of this book. It was born as a newsletter then grew into a fully-fledged resource that questions one of the biggest problems we&#39;re facing as humanity: why are blissfully ignoring the non-screen part of our lives?</p>
<p>As a creative person from the field, Jess speaks the cruel truths, criticizes the numb and careless marketing approach blasting inboxes, and reminds us that life is eventually an offline platform. I admire the bold and confident tone. Sometimes we need to burn bridges to stop ourselves from crossing again.</p>
<p>The mixture of serif and monospaced fonts with a &quot;yeah, this would look good on paper&quot; layout was also appealing. It&#39;s not published as an e-book anyways.</p>
<p>After this book is published, Jess started a new project: <a href="https://nofun.tips">https://nofun.tips</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Here are some takeaways:</p>
<p>The money spent on voracious advertising is not worth it. P&amp;G cut 200$M of their budget, and it had no correlatable impact on sales.</p>
<p>The web became an eyeball monetizing platform instead of serving its purpose: giving voice to the voiceless, free information, and education. It kinda reminds me of this quote from some guy: &quot;We wanted flying cars; instead, we got 140 characters.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>When it comes to marketing strategy, everyone is doing what someone else is doing. There&#39;s no solid reasoning behind most of the campaigns and ads we&#39;re being exposed to while browsing online.</p>
<p>The less aggressive (like native/content marketing) are more relevant and valuable than traditional ones. However, they kill the creative freedom of the content creator because they need to focus on what creates the monetary value instead of what they want to make.</p>
<p>Boredom is inherently a good thing. Yet, society doesn&#39;t value it. So, instead, we fake being busy. When we are not busy creating, we are busy consuming. Extremely annoying.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-are-you-doing-this-just-because">Why are you doing this? Just because!</h3>
<ul>
<li>It permits to create at the most explosive level.</li>
<li>It feels right, it would be fun, it would be weird.</li>
</ul>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In science, we move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform our opinions as well.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="priming">Priming</h2>
<p>External factors, certain behavior, and prior experience effects our unconscious thinking while making decisions.</p>
<p>Unconscious is always working to make a meaning out of the sensor data and process.</p>
<p>When a stimulus effects the way we behave and think, or the way we perceive another stimulus later on, it&#39;s called priming.</p>
<h3 id="study-did-you-just-wash-your-guilt-away">Study: did you just wash your guilt away?</h3>
<p>People asked to think about their biggest immoral behavior.<br>Half of them washed their hands after the experiment, and the other half didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>41% of the people who washed their hands said yes to taking part in a later research to help a desperate student. 74% of who didn&#39;t wash their hands attended to that.</p>
<p>We relate &quot;washing/cleaning&quot; to cleansing, so the first half &quot;washed their guilt away&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="study-i-negotiate-like-a-businessman-because-thats-how-i-roll">Study: I negotiate like a businessman because that&#39;s how I roll</h3>
<p>People sat in two different rooms: one filled with business material such as suitcases, and another with neutral stuff.</p>
<p>Then they played an &quot;ultimatum game&quot; with somebody to split a 10$ reward.</p>
<p>Business room tend to negotiate more (33% wanted to split evenly) then the neutral room (91%).</p>
<p>Funny thing is they didn&#39;t realize the objects in the room, and constructed narratives to make a reasoning of their behavior.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-deal-with-priming">How to deal with priming?</h3>
<p>We can&#39;t self-prime, it has to be unconscious. In fact, it&#39;s enormously helps us by freeing up space for the conscious mind in the case of executive decisions.</p>
<p>Yet, we can create environments to nudge our mind to create mental states we wish to arrive.</p>
<p>Some of the primes are unintended, but in many cases there&#39;s an agent on the other end who plotted against our judgment. Business discovered it before the psychologists: casinos (sound of geld, no day/night distinction), coca-cola (ownership of santa claus).</p>
<h2 id="confabulation">Confabulation</h2>
<p>We are often ignorant of our motivations, and create fictional narratives to explain our decisions, emotions, and history. We don&#39;t realize it&#39;s not the absolute truth, and find it hard to falsify.</p>
<p>&quot;Blindspot&quot;: the point where our optic nerve breaks into retina, and the moving dots experiment. We can&#39;t perceive the second dot, yet the same doesn&#39;t apply when we close our eyes and look around the room. The mental photoshopping happens in that case. The way we fill the gaps of memories is similar, based on the history and beliefs.</p>
<p>Over time, those narratives build up the story of who we are.</p>
<h3 id="split-brain">Split-brain</h3>
<p>Confabulation observed more thoroughly in split-brain patients. (Two halves of the brain are disconnected, sometimes it&#39;s done surgically to make diseases like epilepsy more manageable.) They have a clear distinction of their visual hemispheres. Our left-brain is more capable when it comes to reasoning, where the right-brain does more autonomous tasks.</p>
<p>Although the patients can live an OK life, the lack of connection on their two sides creates a consistent confabulation. But they never feel confused of deceptive.</p>
<p><strong>Example study:</strong> Split-brain patients are shown two words: &quot;bell&quot; on the left, and &quot;music&quot; on the right. Then they are asked to point out with their right hand in a series of photos: bell, drummer, organ, and trumpet.</p>
<p>They only chosen &quot;bell&quot; and explained it by &quot;hearing the college&#39;s bell towers&quot; before the experiment.</p>
<p>When the left hemisphere is forced to explain why the right hemisphere is doing something, it creates a fiction that both sides agree on.</p>
<h3 id="phenomenology">Phenomenology</h3>
<p>Phenomenology is the result of thinking, not the process that appears in the consciousness. We collect and report what the unconscious produces.</p>
<p>Explaining notions like colors and taste is hard without actually experiencing it. These are called &quot;qualia&quot;, the minimum building blocks of the consciousness.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-deal-with-confabulation">How to deal with confabulation?</h3>
<p>Take your narratives with a grain of salt. Just like you are listening a story of the last night from a friend.</p>
<h2 id="confirmation-bias">Confirmation Bias</h2>
<p>Our opinions are the result of years of paying attention to information that confirmed what we believed, while ignoring information that challenged our preconceived notions.</p>
<p>Confirmation bias is seeing the world through a filter. The real trouble beings when it distorts our active pursuit of facts.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-deal-with-it">How to deal with it?</h3>
<p>In science, we move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform our opinions as well.</p>
<h2 id="hindsight-bias">Hindsight Bias</h2>
<p>We tend to edit our memories so we don&#39;t seem like a dimwit (stupid) when things happen in a way we couldn&#39;t have predicted: &quot;I KNEW IT!&quot;</p>
<p>Once we learn from our mistakes, we just replace the bad information with the good one, and delete the garbage. That&#39;s a great way to declutter.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-deal-with-it-1">How to deal with it?</h3>
<p>Have an healthy skepticism when politicians and businessman talk about their past decisions.</p>
<p>Oh, also yourself.</p>
<h2 id="the-texas-sharpshooter-fallacy">The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy</h2>
<p>If hindsight bias and confirmation bias had a baby, that would be this one.</p>
<p>We correlate random events with each other to determine a cause and effect: Kennedy/Lincoln assassinations, Titan(book)/Titanic(movie), Nostradamus guessing Hitler&#39;s arrival.</p>
<p>It resembles a cowboy shooting at the barn and drilling random holes. Then he paints a bulls-eye around the spots with many holes. Well, he&#39;s a sharp-shooter now.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-deal-with-it-2">How to deal with it?</h3>
<p>Recognize all the randomness what got us here. The whole universe is an ocean of coincidences...</p>

        <updated>2020-12-22T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's impossible to learn which you believe you already know.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&quot;Warrior-philosopher&quot;, is a person who practices the art of living in his or her actions. Stoicism seeks for answers on &quot;how to live&quot; and expects us to reflect our values to our actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you didn&#39;t learn these things in order to demonstrate them in practice, what did you learn them for?</p>
<p>– Epictetus</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="promise-1---eudaimonia">Promise 1 - Eudaimonia</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;eu&quot; -&gt; being good</li>
<li>&quot;daimon&quot; -&gt; inner spirit</li>
</ul>
<p>Nature wants us to become the highest versions of ourselves.</p>
<p>It&#39;s in our nature to fulfil that potential, aim to be in harmony with our ideal self.</p>
<p>We can close the gap between our current self and the ideal one by living in arete (virtue).</p>
<h3 id="promise-2---emotional-resilience">Promise 2 - Emotional Resilience</h3>
<p>Basically learning to take punches, and practicing anti-fragility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.</p>
<p>– Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strong emotions are our ultimate weaknesses. We have to learn how to deal with them. It&#39;s not about getting rid of emotions (lowercase stoic), it&#39;s about acknowledging them, reflecting on cause, and teach ourselves to redirect them for our own good.</p>
<h3 id="power-of-ethymia-tranquility">Power of ethymia (tranquility)</h3>
<p>Knowing your path and trying your best to accomplish what&#39;s needed to be on it.</p>
<p>You&#39;re confident on what you do is right, and don&#39;t need to listen what the others say.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-stoicism">History of Stoicism</h2>
<p>Zeno, a phoenician merchant who lost his wealth in a shipwreck living in Cyprus. He moves to Athens, studies Socrates&#39;s teachings (and in several academies), then starts to teach in public.</p>
<h4 id="seneca-4-bce---65-ce">Seneca (4 BCE - 65 CE)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lived an extraordinary life.</li>
<li>Successful, wealthy playwright.</li>
<li>Exiled and brought back to tutor Nero.</li>
<li>Ordered to kill himself by Nero, in front of his family and friends.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="musonius-rufus-30-ce---100-ce">Musonius Rufus (30 CE - 100 CE)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Didn&#39;t write anything down but his students did.</li>
<li>Also exiled to Gyaros by Nero.</li>
<li>Came back after Nero died, and taught more.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="epictetus-55-ce---135-ce">Epictetus (55 CE - 135 CE)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Student of Rufus.</li>
<li>Born as a slave, allowed to study by his master, then permanently set free due to his intelligence.</li>
<li>Lived a simple life with a few possessions.</li>
<li>Didn&#39;t write, but his students took notes (Discourses)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="marcus-aurelius-121-ce---180-ce">Marcus Aurelius (121 CE - 180 CE)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Was an emperor of the Roman Empire (the last of 5 great emperors)</li>
<li>Didn&#39;t use his power to preach Stoicism</li>
<li>His private journals published as Meditations</li>
<li>Was slow but steady when it comes to wars.</li>
</ul>
<p>Low tendency to preach Stoicism is one of the fundamentals of the philosophy. Living it by example is much more effective then forcing others. This mindset, however, prevented Stoicism to spread widely, and Christianity became more popular.</p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/the-little-book-of-stoicism/triangle.jpg" alt="The Stoic Happiness Triangle"></p>
<h3 id="living-with-arete">Living with arete</h3>
<p>It&#39;s merely natural to not be the &quot;best version&quot; of ourselves. Yet the gap should be the motivation to learn from our mistakes and grow.</p>
<p>Our ability to use reason divides us from other beings, and help us to act mindfully, being aware of our actions and consequences.</p>
<h4 id="four-cardinal-virtues">Four cardinal virtues</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wisdom</li>
<li>Justice</li>
<li>Courage</li>
<li>Self-discipline</li>
</ul>
<p>The perfect stoic &quot;Sage&quot;, an imaginary person who lives accordingly to all Stoic virtues. &quot;What would Sage do?&quot;</p>
<p>Being virtuous requires paying &quot;attention.&quot; It&#39;s about intercepting the reactions of lizard brain, and enhancing/changing them with respect to our virtues.</p>
<p>Living with arete is it&#39;s own reward. The positive feelings, and material outcomes are just added bonuses.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://altay.wtf/notes/formula-of-humanity">Kant&#39;s ethics</a>, we do the right thing just because it&#39;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The goal is to be useful, to help others, and take care of ourselves and everybody else.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-what-you-control">Focus on what you control</h3>
<ul>
<li>High influence: our choices in judgments and actions</li>
<li>Partial influence: health, wealth, relationships, and outcomes of our behaviors.</li>
<li>No influence: weather, ethnicity, and most external circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Focus on the process, do your best, and accept whatever outcome.</p>
<p>Success is defined by our effort to do everything that&#39;s within our power.</p>
<p>It&#39;s futile to fight what already happened, it&#39;s wise to continue despite it.</p>
<p>The hallmark of an admirable poker player is to play regardless of their cards.</p>
<h3 id="take-responsibility">Take responsibility</h3>
<p>We are responsible for our own flourishing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want anything good, you must get it from yourself.</p>
<p>– Epictetus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking responsibility will increase our changes of attaining eudaimonia. The victim mentality brings nothing but despair.</p>
<p>Outside events have the power of effecting our life, but not ruining it.</p>
<p>Only you can ruin your life by getting fooled around by the things you don&#39;t control, and by failing to act despite them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot choose our external circumstances. But we can change how we react to them.</p>
<p>– Epictetus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Freedom of choice&quot;: stepping back from automatic response and acting mindfully. We can turn negative, impulsive reactions to positive, or no reaction at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>There&#39;s nothing good or bad unless we choose to make it so.</li>
<li>We shouldn&#39;t try to lead events but follow them. Resistance is futile, take things as they come, and make the best of what&#39;s in your power.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-villain-negative-emotions-get-in-the-way">The villain: negative emotions get in the way</h3>
<p>Negative emotions naturally feel bad, and our number one priority becomes to feel better. Then we automatically seek relief of the pain in the present moment, regardless of our values and goals. We end up walking away like a coward, ordering pizza and tiramisu, binge-watching Netflix, smash doors, and buy things we don&#39;t need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the enemy has entered the mind, reason is gone.</p>
<p>– Seneca</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our tendency to survival evolved our brains to have negativity bias. Scarcity of resources and dangers made us pay attention to negative more than the positive.</p>
<p>Negative emotions come from wanting and fearing what&#39;s not under our control. We need to be aware and detach irrational fears and cravings before we can endure them with courage and perseverance, or abstain from them with discretion and self-discipline.</p>
<p>Awareness buys us time and delay for trying to make a rational decision.</p>
<h2 id="stoic-practices">Stoic Practices</h2>
<h4 id="what-stands-in-the-way-becomes-the-way">What stands in the way becomes the way</h4>
<ul>
<li>Challenges are opportunities.</li>
<li>It&#39;s within our control to use them to practice our skills.</li>
<li>Life supposed to be challenging. Who said it&#39;s going to be easy?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="remember-impermanence">Remember impermanence</h4>
<ul>
<li>Things change, we change, and nothing lasts forever.</li>
<li>Think about all the people lived before us, and the ones will live after.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="negative-visualization">Negative visualization</h4>
<ul>
<li>Train to face adversity</li>
<li>What could go wrong, how?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="voluntary-discomfort">Voluntary discomfort</h4>
<ul>
<li>Temporary poverty.</li>
<li>Get into uncomfortable situations.</li>
<li>Purposefully forgo pleasure.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="morning-routine">Morning routine</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gratefulness to life and nature</li>
<li>Remember the virtues and values</li>
<li>Plan the day</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="evening-routine">Evening routine</h4>
<p>Review the day, put things on paper to set the mind free.</p>
<ul>
<li>good: what went well?</li>
<li>better: what could I do better?</li>
<li>best: what do I need to active the best version?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="eliminate-the-nonessential">Eliminate the nonessential</h4>
<ul>
<li>Get rid of material possessions, routines, etc. that don&#39;t provide value</li>
<li>Live simple, fortune can be taken away any moment</li>
<li>Cut back time from news and other distractions</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="win-at-what-matters">Win at what matters</h4>
<p>We become experts in many things yet we still don&#39;t know how to live. Memorizing all the Marvel movies is much less useful than practicing self-control.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s nothing harder than learning how to live.</p>
<p>– Seneca</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="become-an-eternal-student">Become an eternal student</h4>
<ul>
<li>Seek for the wisdom and be humble.</li>
<li>Put your learnings to practice.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s impossible to learn which you believe you already know.</p>
<p>– Epictetus</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="beat-fear-with-preparation-and-reason">Beat fear with preparation and reason</h4>
<p>Lack of control and attachment to external things and desires leads to fear.</p>
<p>The common way is to hide from fear, but the proper way is to think about it rationally and calmly, till it becomes familiar.</p>
<h4 id="pain-and-provocation-great-opportunities-for-virtue">Pain and provocation: great opportunities for virtue</h4>
<ul>
<li>Every accident is an opportunity to practice arete.</li>
<li>Every headache is a chance not to curse.</li>
<li>Every annoying person is a chance for patience.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="other-ize">Other-ize</h4>
<p>The way we respond to some else&#39;s problems is more rational.</p>
<p>Detaching from &quot;I&#39;m special and why does it always rain on me?&quot; mindsets help to maintain a balanced mind.</p>
<h4 id="take-the-birds-eye-view">Take the bird&#39;s-eye view</h4>
<p>Our massive problem suddenly gets utterly insignificant on the macroscopic scale. Put things in perspective, and stay indifferent to external things that others mistakenly value – like wealth, looks, or social status.</p>
<h4 id="its-the-old-same-thing">It&#39;s the old same thing</h4>
<p>It&#39;s not the first time that happens to somebody. Hundreds experienced before us, and hundreds will do after we&#39;re gone.</p>
<h4 id="avoid-rashness">Avoid rashness</h4>
<p>Refuse to accept the impulsive reaction, act mindfully. Pause, and test impressions.</p>
<h4 id="nobody-errs-on-purpose">Nobody errs on purpose</h4>
<p>Don&#39;t blame the people because they did wrong. &quot;Nobody does wrong willingly,&quot; says Socrates.</p>
<p>It takes no sense to get angry. Lead by example and support them instead of judging.</p>
<h4 id="find-your-own-faults">Find your own faults</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are offended at any man&#39;s fault, turn to yourself and study your own feelings. Then you will forget your anger.</p>
<p>– Epictetus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ve also made many mistakes till now. And still counting.</p>
<h4 id="forgive-and-love-those-who-stumble">Forgive and love those who stumble</h4>
<ul>
<li>The stumbling people are our relatives.</li>
<li>They do wrong involuntarily.</li>
<li>We&#39;re all going to die anyway.</li>
<li>We can only be harmed if we choose so.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="insults">Insults</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The best revenge is to be unlike them who performed the injury.</p>
<p>– Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laugh it off.</p>
<h4 id="dont-abandon-others-nor-yourself-but-choose-your-company-well">Don&#39;t abandon others nor yourself, but choose your company well</h4>
<p>We shouldn&#39;t abandon people just because we choose to change, but we shouldn&#39;t abandon our new path as well.</p>
<p>Remaining kind and patient during the process is the real challenge.</p>
<p>Still, we have freedom to choose who to spend our time with. Spend more time with people to grow. Don&#39;t break-up and abandon the others, but consciously spend less time.</p>
<h4 id="dont-judge-but-yourself">Don&#39;t judge but yourself</h4>
<p>Prejudice and the urge of correcting others is a road to pain suffering.</p>
<p>We engage in the practice to improve ourselves, not to fix others.</p>
<h4 id="listen-more-and-say-only-whats-not-better-left-unsaid">Listen more, and say only what&#39;s not better left unsaid</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>We have two ears and a mount for a reason. To listen more and talk less.</p>
<p>– Zeno</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody enjoys the self-indulging stories. We enjoy while telling them, but do we also enjoy while listening?</p>
<p>Put into practice what you preach.</p>
<p>People remember what you did when they forgot what you said.</p>

<p>Our actions are hard to explain by pure intention and logic. Over the history, we didn&#39;t really understand the logic behind accurate guesses. Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud tried to explain the source of behavior is connected to subconscious. Today, Neuroscience enables the inspection of brain to interpret reactions more clearly. Neuroscience has been the quantum physics of psychology. It showed us the human mind is beyond what we thought.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of our actions are driven by unconscious mind that is evolved for survival.</li>
<li>Although it helps us to take shortcuts, our unconscious mind is also biased in many aspects.</li>
<li>We can tame our unconscious mind by understanding how it works, setting conscious goals, and acting mindfully.</li>
<li>Living a contradicting experience is a great way to eradicate bias.</li>
<li>Using <em>Theory of Mind</em> is a wonderful way to develop empathy and mindfulness.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="part-1-the-two-tiered-brain">Part 1: The Two-Tiered Brain</h2>
<p>Most of the primitive creatures act &quot;programmatically&quot; to fulfill their basic instincts of survival and reproduction.</p>
<p>Humans (and mammals) have developed a part of brain that gives us the ability to make conscious decisions. Yet the pure logical conscious brain is a myth](../notes/consciousness-car).</p>
<p>Our experiences shape the unconscious mind to direct our thinking towards certain ends. Mlodinow&#39;s mother for example, lost her mother at 16 to cancer, and her father, sister, and she were taken by the Nazis in Poland. She lost her sister and father, eventually escaped to the US to start a middle-low class life. Yet her traumatic early experiences made her think disastrously in such situations like Leonard skipping a routine phone call when he was studying away from home. His mom thought Leonard has died and his roommate didn&#39;t answer her calls to hide his death. In fact, Leonard was out for a date.</p>
<h4 id="freud-and-the-subconscious">Freud and the subconscious</h4>
<p>Sigmund Freud made great scientific progress to understand the brain connectivity and neural interactions.</p>
<p>Yet pursued in the clinical path and developed a theory for the subconscious based on his therapy. However, this method was inadequate since explaining the subconscious based on what patients tell him is scientifically unreliable (we will learn why in the upcoming chapters).</p>
<p>Freud suggested the subconscious is a defense mechanism that oppresses our desires to not take irrational actions.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-1-the-new-unconscious">Chapter 1: The New Unconscious</h3>
<p>The new unconscious view the subconscious as a gift rather than a protection mechanism. Our subconscious helps us to direct our behavior based on the experiences and our interpretation of the materialistic world.</p>
<p>Some –hard to extract from what patients tell in therapy– examples of subconscious:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to feel important, this have a tendency to have a bias towards people who share similar traits. People tend to marry with others that have the same surname.</li>
<li>Popcorn-box combination experiment. Attendants decided how much to eat based on the taste of the popcorn and size of the boxes. Doubling the size of snack container increase consumption by 30-45 percent.</li>
<li>Fluency effect: we tend to like food, or find it more tasty based on the fonts used in the menu. It also shows the corporations with more readable names gained more interest during an IPO. <strong>So economy is not only about rational decisions based on self-interest.</strong></li>
<li>The pepsi paradox: people prefer Coke, but Pepsi tastes better in a no-label experiment. Well, it&#39;s not a paradox. It&#39;s the perception of brand in our unconscious.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, our unconscious minds are active, purposeful, and independent. They might be hidden, but their effects play a critical role in how the conscious minds perceive the world.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2-senses--mind--reality">Chapter 2: Senses + Mind = Reality</h3>
<p>TL;DR: Kant is right! There is reality that exists objectively, independent from us. Then there is another one build up by our senses and mind: the perceived reality.</p>
<p>The story of Charles Sanders Pierce, a pioneer in researching unconscious:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stolen golden watch story (he guessed the burglar without no conscious evidence)</li>
<li>The weight perception experience (there is a threshold that we can sense in a set of weights perceived by our senses, and it&#39;s proportional)</li>
</ul>
<p>He founded &quot;the philosophical doctrine of pragmatism&quot; and claimed that the philosophical ideas or theories should be viewed as instruments, not absolute truths.</p>
<p><strong>An early metaphor for mental actions:</strong> There are two trains, unconscious and conscious which makes decisions. Now, it&#39;s viewed more like two railway systems with intersections.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the unconscious part is more fundamental. It&#39;s developed far before than the conscious part. The unconscious takes up the 99% of the energy spent in brain. It&#39;s a bit funny, but playing chess vs watching television does not differ as drastically as running outside vs being a couch potato. Playing chess rather than watching TV increases the energy consumption only about 1%.</p>
<h4 id="processing-visual-data">Processing visual data</h4>
<p>One of the most important functions of the unconscious part is processing visual data. It occupies one-third of the brain capacity. It&#39;s developed to serve our survival instincts.</p>
<p>A patient with a damaged visual system that helps the conscious part can still distinguish images that trigger senses. He was able to differentiate happy and sad faces, where the results were not the same for geometric shapes. He was also able to walk without a cane, didn&#39;t step on to objects on the floor.</p>
<p>Faces play a special role in human behavior. Our facial expressions usually reflect how we perceive certain situations. That&#39;s why Helen of Troy said to have &quot;a face that launched a thousand ships,&quot; not breasts.</p>
<h4 id="blindsight">Blindsight</h4>
<p>&quot;Blindsight&quot; is the phenomena that claims the individuals can still respond to events without visually perceiving them in the conscious mind.</p>
<p>An artificial way to create blindsight is to show one eye a moving picture and the other one a static one that triggers an instinct, such as sexual desire.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t consciously perceive everything registered in our brain, so unconscious mind may notice something that conscious doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Another interesting concept that proves the wold we perceive is an artificial one is phonemic restoration. We fill in the blanks when something is missing to construct a meaning of what we perceive. It&#39;s done by the unconscious part and we totally believe. Sometimes they are biases towards the physical properties of the people we encounter such as race and ethnicity. We also match the concepts such as &quot;orange&quot; and &quot;peel&quot; to complete a sentence.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-3-remembering-and-forgetting">Chapter 3: Remembering and Forgetting</h3>
<p>The case for memory distortion: false eyewitness identification, Jennifer Thompson, the victim who false identified her rapist during the line-up. She was relatively calm and trying to memorize the accuser during the incident. Yet she only remembered severe details to identify Ronald Cotton. But the actual suspect was actually Bobby Pole, another inmate Cotton met at the prison. The DNA test made the case accurate after 10 years.</p>
<p>James Dean and watergate. Dean was known as a man with a &quot;tape recorder&quot; memory. Yet his most recollections were false. They were either defend himself, or Raegan, who was actually tape recording everything.</p>
<h4 id="hugo-münsterberg-and-explorations-of-the-new-conscious">Hugo Münsterberg and explorations of the new conscious</h4>
<p>Munsterberg, another pioneering psychologist in the new conscious research, realized his memory distortion while filing a police report for a break-in to his house while they were away for a vacation. Most of his conclusions were based on what he heard from the policemen, and assumptions developed afterwards.</p>
<p>In fact, Munsterberg was very good in terms of memory. He gave over three thousand lectures without a single note. His studies on memory shown that the classical assumption of &quot;our memories work like a rape recorder&quot; was inaccurate.</p>
<p>He believed none of us can remember everything we are confronted. Instead, we remember certain blueprints, then fill the rest according to our belief systems and prior experience, sometimes to be self-serving. Additionally, we believe the memories we make up (confabulation).</p>
<p>Despite being a pioneer, one downside of Munsterberg was ignoring the unconscious mind. It&#39;s probably related with living in the same era as Freud, who where constructing a narrative that contradicts with Munsterberg&#39;s rational approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story of the subconscious mind can be told in three words: there is none.</p>
<p>– Hugo Münsterberg</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-man-who-remembered-everything-sheresevsky">The man who remembered everything: Sheresevsky</h4>
<p>Sheresevsky, a man lived in Russia, was able to remember everything. Yet he lacked interpretation. He didn&#39;t remember a person from her face. There were many faces that belonged to that person in his mind.</p>
<p>It shows that we evolved to trade perfect recall for the ability to handle and process information.</p>
<h4 id="two-types-of-language-structure">Two types of language structure</h4>
<ul>
<li>Surface: specific way the idea is suggested, with exact words and everything.</li>
<li>Deep: the gist of the idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>We tend to make a gist out of our experiences based on the emotions. Then we fill up the missing parts when remembering them in the future. Sometimes we do that dramatically, and biased.</p>
<h4 id="false-memory-experiments">False memory experiments</h4>
<p>Supporting to our power make ourselves believe in what we make up, there were a few good false memory placement experiments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hot air balloon ride: two of your childhood pics + one photoshopped.</li>
<li>Meeting with Bugs Bunny in Disneyland: he&#39;s a Warner Bros character.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all, our memory is similar to sensors in the previous chapter. A big portion of it powered by the unconscious.</p>
<p>The lesson is to be humble, because our memories could be misplaced, and grateful both for the memories we can retain and the ability to not retain all of them.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-4-the-importance-of-being-social">Chapter 4: The Importance of Being Social</h3>
<p>Social and emotional connections are beyond words, and can be understood through unconscious thought.</p>
<p>We value and amire kind, helpful behaviors. So being nice is it&#39;s own reward. It&#39;s also attracting other emotional beings.</p>
<p>Our tendency for social acceptance based on kindness starts to develop at early ages (~6 months). Babies that watch animations of &quot;shapes with eyes&quot; being rude (square brick tries to climb, triangle helps, circle pushes it down) or being neutral (circle is just a bystander) tend to reject playing with shapes that aren&#39;t helpful.</p>
<p>Another experiment made in 1950&#39;s in University of Minnesota. They gathered 2 x 30 female students. To the first group, they say there will be electroshocks it will hurt. To the second group, they said the electroshocks will just tickle. The group that expects painful experience waited in groups (66% - 33% in comparison) even though they had enough waiting rooms for every individual. So we seek help and unification with others when we are anxious.</p>
<h4 id="social-pain-is-also-physical">Social pain is also physical</h4>
<p>Tylenol (painkiller) experiment. People who took 2-tablets per day shown less affection from social problems compared to the people that took placebos. Lack of social connection constitutes a major risk factor for health.</p>
<h4 id="social-intelligence-and-the-theory-of-mind">Social intelligence and the &quot;Theory of Mind&quot;</h4>
<p>Social intelligence is a result of our evolution. IT has been crucial to our survival. Human kind&#39;s ability to band together and organize preceded all the other creatures.</p>
<p>Social intelligence is not only corralated to IQ. It&#39;s influenced more by your desire and ability to understand what other people think and feel. It&#39;s called &quot;Theory of Mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of our understanding in ToM comes from unconscious mind. There are levels of ToM.</p>
<ol>
<li>What I think</li>
<li>What I think about what you think</li>
<li>What I think about what you think about what I think</li>
<li>What I think about what you think about what I think about what you think</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>
<p>Politicians and businessman are usually successful to think in 4th order.</p>
<h4 id="chain-letters">Chain letters</h4>
<p>It takes five steps to find two connected people by forwarding through connections. Same experiment done with both letters and email.</p>
<h4 id="mammals-and-social-intelligence">Mammals and social intelligence</h4>
<p>Although we developed this complex brain and ToM (other mammals can do max 2nd order), there is also a big range of common behavior. Those behaviors are mostly on the unconscious side, and influenced by hormones.</p>
<p><strong>Male Mammals</strong> -&gt; reproductive success determined by competing with other males to mate with as many females as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Female Mammals</strong> -&gt; reproductive strategy is investing in production of relatively few offspring, and take care of them as they grow.</p>
<p>Oxytocin: love, trust. Vasopressin: commitment. Two hormones playing a key role in social interactions.</p>
<h4 id="social-neuroscience">Social neuroscience</h4>
<p>To investigate the effects of social connections, we have a new field called social neuroscience. Invention of fMRI contributed to many studies and made it clear that here&#39;s no way to understand human mind by focusing on rational or emotional extreme.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cognitive psychology:</em> mostly focuses on rational end.</li>
<li><em>Social psychology:</em> mostly focused on emotional end.</li>
<li>Two + neuroscience =&gt; social neuroscience.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of neuroscience, our brain consists of three main parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reptilian Brain: basic survival - fight or flight.</li>
<li>Limbic System (Old Mammal Brain): unconscious social perception and reflective reptilian emotions.</li>
<li>Neocortex (New Mammal Brain): homo sapiens! Evolved 200.000 years ago, effective around 50.000 years. Positioned on the frontal lobe, it&#39;s what makes us human. Conscious thought, planning and orchestrating in accordance of our goals happen here.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="part-2-the-social-unconscious">Part 2: The Social Unconscious</h2>
<h3 id="chapter-5-reading-people">Chapter 5: Reading People</h3>
<p>We unconsciously signal our expectations by our body language: gestures, facial expressions, posture, tone of voice.</p>
<p>Animals do that too, and they can also learn and understand human&#39;s intentions through the body language. Dogs evolved to understand humans the best.</p>
<h4 id="vasco-de-gama-rats">Vasco de Gama Rats</h4>
<p>Participants communicated more kindly with the &quot;Vasco de Gama&quot; rats (that are told to have abilities in mazes). In fact, they didn&#39;t. Yet those rats performed better than the other group (of stupid rats).</p>
<p>Similar things applied for teacher&#39;s behaviors against a class with &quot;talented&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; students. Brilliant (to be told) ones increased their IQ even more.</p>
<h4 id="non-linguistic-communication-in-primates">Non-linguistic communication in primates</h4>
<p>Direct stare means treat, smile means &quot;I won&#39;t attack you&quot;, or &quot;please don&#39;t attack me, you&#39;re the best!&quot;</p>
<p>Based on researches to rate human facial expressions in cross-demographies, it seems like our catalog of facial expressions are an inherent part of our being.</p>
<h4 id="dominance">Dominance</h4>
<ul>
<li>Physical dominance: voice, body, carrying a gun :D</li>
<li>Social dominance: expensive (or non-expensive) clothing, cars, watches</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visual dominance ratio.</strong> We automatically adjust the amount of time we&#39;re looking onto another person&#39;s eyes as a function of our relative social dominance. Percentage of the time you look while you are speaking against while you are listening is the visual dominance ratio. People tend to look more while speaking and less while listening when they&#39;re dominant.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-6-judging-people-by-their-covers">Chapter 6: Judging People by Their Covers</h3>
<p>Cowbird females get attracted to males by their voice. Even when it&#39;s coming from a stereo.</p>
<p>Humans also behave similarly in certain situations when voice is involved. We tend to trust love and relationship advices from women more, since they are known as &quot;keepers.&quot; We obey orders from male voices more. We are not very biased on neutral topics. (I doubt that, but cool.)</p>
<p>Voice tone (deep-high) also effects humans when they are choosing their partners. People with physical dominance (long muscular male with hairy chest) sometimes adjust their voice tone to settle the conditions in social interactions (aww). Or the non-dominant individual does the opposite, especially if the case is competitive.</p>
<h4 id="first-presidential-debate-on-air-nixon-vs-jfk-60-elections">First presidential debate on air: Nixon vs. JFK (60&#39; Elections)</h4>
<p>Nixon had a knee problem and he was in the hospital. Yet he wanted to attend to the debate. He was looking pale and unhealthy. People in the TV insisted Nixon to wear a make up, but he said he&#39;d only do it if Kennedy also does. Kennedy refused, so he followed.</p>
<p>It&#39;s said to be a determining factor (even the next generations that are neutral found Kennedy more &quot;votable&quot; just by watching the recording) on the race. Nixon&#39;s vice-president candidate said &quot;That motherfucker just costed us the elections.&quot;</p>
<p>Another evidence for the importance of the look: people in Nixon&#39;s party who listened the debate through the radio didn&#39;t think it was too bad, until they re-watched the video recording.</p>
<p>Many other researches made in the US shown that &quot;competent&quot; looking candidates have enormous advantage when there&#39;s no strong ideology involved.</p>
<p>Some random findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast speakers create more trust they give a sense of competence.</li>
<li>Touching to forearm triggers some empathic feelings. Waiters got more tips and guys get more numbers on street when they did that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leonard says we can&#39;t turn off the &quot;judging by look&quot; ability. It&#39;ll always be there, as the other findings in the book.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-7-sorting-people-and-things">Chapter 7: Sorting People and Things</h3>
<p>Over the history, our species used categorization to increase their chance of survival.</p>
<p>If a bear ate uncle Johnny, then another bear can eat you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Unconscious mind transforms input by using categorization to speed up the reaction time. We are also using categorization to learn and remember things. Even our ability to read is empowered by categorization, so it&#39;s useful in many ways. However, it&#39;s also making us biased towards certain things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we categorize, we polarize.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="born-of-the-stereotype">Born of the Stereotype</h4>
<p>Raise of the multi-culture societies and free will brought many different perspectives. Politicians, media, and businessman needed to address them somehow.</p>
<p>In order to leverage the power of mass media and managing the society, we came up with the concept of stereotypes. Then we started to generalize the behaviors –mostly negative because we also have a negativity bias.</p>
<p><strong>Shoplifter reporting experiment.</strong> People reported &quot;poor looking&quot; shoplifters more than the &quot;good looking&quot; ones, and they also used more enthusiastic language when reporting the poor ones.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-not-to-be-a-racist">How to not to be a racist</h4>
<p>We can fight with our unconscious in parallel to our conscious goals and values to tame biases. Still, as it&#39;s been said in <a href="https://altay.wtf/books/everything-is-fucked">Everything is Fucked</a>, the most effective way to change a belief is to have a contradictory experience. That&#39;s the number one reason why forming multi-cultural, diverse, and inclusive groups are important.</p>
<p>It also seems like we&#39;re making progress (on polarizing :D), considering the disapproval rate of supremacist comments made by prolific people like Che Guevara (said &quot;negro is lazy&quot;) and Abraham Lincoln (implied &quot;white-black never be equal&quot;).</p>
<h3 id="chapter-8-in-groups-and-out-groups">Chapter 8: In-groups and Out-groups</h3>
<h4 id="robbels-cave-camp-experiment">Robbels Cave Camp Experiment</h4>
<p>11 x 2 eleven year old boys were called into a three week camp. They&#39;re almost indifferent in terms of race, socioeconomic and physical attributes.</p>
<p>They spent a week without being aware of the other group, banded and even created a name/flag/song for their group.</p>
<p>In the second week, teachers made them aware of the second group. They instantly wanted to compete with them in sports. Losing side burnt the flag ot he other team. The team with the burnt flag invaded and messed up the other team&#39;s room. In summary, there was a strong &quot;US-VERSUS-THEM&quot; feeling in the air.</p>
<p>(Rest of the story coming at the end)</p>
<p>As this study also shows, humans are not famous with their hospitality against groups they see different from themselves.</p>
<p>Sometimes we even make sacrifices to belong to a group. Most common pattern is the financial sacrifice. Mac-users vs PC-users, country club members, &quot;senior&quot; people who are OK to get promotion rather than salary increase.</p>
<h4 id="in-group-bias">In-group bias</h4>
<p>In-group/out-group mindset makes us think that our in-group members are a lot more sophisticated. We tend to prefer them for social and business dealings.</p>
<p>Our self-identification also effects the performance. A study in Harvard on asian-american women students. They got a difficult math test, but divided into three groups that filled different questionnaires before the test.</p>
<ul>
<li>Students who reminded their asian inheritance (correlates to being good at math) did the best.</li>
<li>Students who are asked to answer random cable TV questions (control group) did OK.</li>
<li>Students who reminded that they are women (seen as bad at math) did the worst.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="us-versus-them-but-for-real">Us versus them, but for real...</h4>
<p>Sometimes the excluding behavior comes before the benefits of the tribe. Henri Tajfel experiment: you have limited amount of points to distribute between two people. The difference between distribution effects the total points, and you don&#39;t have to distribute all.</p>
<ul>
<li>In-group (5 points – max) vs. In-group (5 points – max)</li>
<li>Out-group (1 points – min) vs. Out-group (1 points – min)</li>
<li>In-group (4 points – not max) vs. Out-group (1 points – min)</li>
</ul>
<p>People were OK to give less points to in-group for the sake of minimizing out-group outcome.</p>
<h4 id="what-it-takes-to-establish-a-kinsnip">What it takes to establish a kinsnip?</h4>
<p>There&#39;s no minimal requirement to establish a tribe spirit. We can band against any common enemy very quickly.</p>
<p>The key to reduce in-group/out-group rivalry is to make them work together against ANOTHER COMMON ENEMY :D, or a natural disaster.</p>
<p>The two groups of the Robbels Cave Camp were united against solving the water outage and broken meal truck since it was a problem for both.</p>
<p>Mladinow says the same thing happened in 9.11, when he was living very close to the Empire States building.</p>
<p>It&#39;s sad but true.</p>
<p>At least there is a way.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-9-feelings">Chapter 9: Feelings</h3>
<p>William James, the man who lived the lifelong learner&#39;s dream... He studied various fields in very interesting universities, eventually settled down to get medical degree from Harvard. Yet he worked on psychology, as a student of Wundt.</p>
<p>His masterpiece (which he disowned at the time being and left the field for philosophy) The Principles of Psychology (took him 12 years to write) is still one of the most admired works in psychology.</p>
<p>James proposed the idea that psychology follow physiology. For example, we feel bad because we cry, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Emotions, in today&#39;s neo-Jamesian view, are like perceptions and memories. A big portion of the data comes from the unconscious mind, then the conscious part completes the rest with our preexisting beliefs and expectations. Adding the of interpretation of the current circumstances, we construct an emotion.</p>
<h4 id="when-you-know-where-its-coming-from">When you know where it&#39;s coming from...</h4>
<p>Adrenaline experiments: subjects who are informed about the potential increase of their sexual desires where less interested in erotic films. (They were given injections then ran in treadmill)</p>
<p>If we somehow &quot;know&quot; the sources of our impulses, we are able to make more &quot;mindful&quot; decisions.</p>
<h4 id="confabulation">Confabulation</h4>
<p>When we have no idea what led us to certain actions, we make up a narrative to justify our reasoning. The lack of agreement between <a href="https://altay.wtf/notes/consciousness-car">the thinking brain and the feeling brain</a> is the real issue.</p>
<p>Hiring experiment: subjects are evaluating a candidate based on academic success, a coffee-spilling incident, how attractive she is, and their possibility to meet her. Outside attendants are also try to guess why a subject would decide to hire the applicant.</p>
<p>Both the subjects and observers think that academic success was the biggest factor, but it had less effect than the other social norms.</p>
<p>As psychological theory suggested, the subjects had shown no greater interest into their reasoning than the outsiders had.</p>
<p>So we don&#39;t usually see ourselves no other than how the others see us.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s a bit bad. Perhaps the reason of the imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>To minimize the gap, we can broaden our perspectives and invest effort to know ourselves more deeply.</p>
<p>Yet sometimes it&#39;s futile to make a meaning out of everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your mind&#39;s natural view of the world is skewed, it&#39;s skewed for a reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="chapter-10-self">Chapter 10: Self</h3>
<p>When we face with treats to feeling good about ourselves, our tendency to view reality through a distorting lens grows proportionally.</p>
<p>Many people think they are above-average in their professions.</p>
<p>Ironically, we tend to recognize that inflated self-assessment and overconfidence can be a problem–but only in others.</p>
<p>That&#39;s right, we even overestimate our ability to resist overestimating our abilities.</p>
<h4 id="two-ways-to-get-truth">Two ways to get truth</h4>
<ol>
<li>Scientist&#39;s Way: gather evidence, look for regularities, form theories explaining their observations, and test them.</li>
<li>Lawyer&#39;s Way: being with a conclusion they want to convince others of and then seek evidence that supports it, while also attempting to discredit evidence that doesn&#39;t.</li>
</ol>
<p>The human mind is evolved to be the both.</p>
<h4 id="motivated-reasoning">Motivated reasoning</h4>
<p>Motivated reasoning helps us to believe in our own goodness and competence, to feel in control, and to generally see ourselves in an overly positive light.</p>
<p>Our brains show different physical behaviors when the subject is &quot;us&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.</p>

<p>&quot;When you don&#39;t have much time, a routine helps you make the little time you have count. When you have all the time in the world, a routine makes sure you don&#39;t waste it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little imprisonment –if it&#39;s our own making– can set you free.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you have days that differ from the routines, they will feel more remarkable.</p>
<h3 id="making-lists">Making Lists</h3>
<p>A list is a collection with purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>To-do</li>
<li>Won&#39;t do</li>
<li>Pros/Cons</li>
<li>Someday/Maybe</li>
<li>Top 100</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writing-journal">Writing Journal</h3>
<p>Every day is a blank page; when you are done with it, just write down what you accomplished and what you want to achieve the next day, then go to sleep.</p>
<h2 id="2-build-a-bliss-station">2. Build a Bliss Station</h2>
<p>Disconnect from the world to connect with yourself.</p>
<p>The creativity is fed by connection and what we share with others. Yet, we also need to disconnect to create room to allow creation. You must have space and time to retreat and make the most out of silence and solitude.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost everything will be working again if you unplug it for a few minutes –including you.</p>
<p>– Anne Lamott</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turn off your phone, don&#39;t check it the first thing in the morning. Don&#39;t invite the world of anxiety right away. You can survive without news for a few hours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saying &quot;no&quot; to the world can be hard, but sometimes it&#39;s the only way to say &quot;yes&quot; to your art and your sanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="3-forget-the-noun-do-the-verb">3. Forget The Noun, Do The Verb</h2>
<p>Creativity is just a tool, it can be applied to any aspect of life.</p>
<p>When taken too seriously, the job titles can mess you up. They can restrict the kind of works you want to do.</p>
<p>Forget all the nouns together, and do the verbs instead. Do it even the outcome never arrives, or it&#39;s bad.</p>
<h2 id="4-make-gifts">4. Make Gifts</h2>
<p>We&#39;re trained to tread hobbies as side-hustles as the world around us gets monetized every day.</p>
<p>However, turning passion into breadwinning may have side-effects. Your passion can turn into hatred over time.</p>
<p>If you want artistic freedom, keep your overhead low.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Do what you love&quot; + low overhead = a good life.</li>
<li>&quot;Do what you love&quot; + &quot;I deserve a nice living&quot; = a time bomb</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s easy to become obsessed with online metrics such as likes, retweets, visitors, and etc. Ignoring measurements and focusing on what feeds your soul is a more sustainable practice to follow.</p>
<p>Definition of success becomes &quot;sucksess&quot; when it&#39;s influenced by somebody else&#39;s terms. It feels fake, unreachable, or undeserved.</p>
<p>The art exists in both gift and market economies. The quickest way to recover &quot;the feeling of gift&quot; is to make something for someone you care about.</p>
<h2 id="5-the-ordinary--extra-attention--the-extraordinary">5. The Ordinary + Extra Attention = The Extraordinary</h2>
<p>Great artists are able to find magic in the mundane. They create extraordinary things by paying extra attention to ordinary things.</p>
<p>When your job is to see things that others don&#39;t, you have to slow down enough that you can actually look.</p>
<p>Slow thinking, looking, cooking, eating makes us more involved in the process. It indeed requires training in an age obsessed with speed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What you choose to pay attention is the stuff your life and work will be made of.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="6-slay-the-art-monsters">6. Slay The Art Monsters</h2>
<p><strong>Art Monsters:</strong> people who produce great art but have been doing morally wrong things in their personal lives. Austin thinks it&#39;s not ok to tolerate the monstrous failures because of their contributions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If making your art is ruining anyone&#39;s life, including your own, it&#39;s not worth making.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="7-you-are-allowed-to-change-your-mind">7. You Are Allowed To Change Your Mind</h2>
<p>If you&#39;ve never changed your mind about something, pinch yourself, you may be dead!</p>
<p>Changing ideas in public is seen as a weakness for politicians. Speaking with a different tone or mindset may be seen as inconsistent for brands. However, being open to change and embracing uncertainty is the only way to move forward.</p>
<p>IF you really want to change (or strengthen) your ideas, consider hanging out with people (or consume resources) that aren&#39;t so much like-minded. Instead of just reacting with rejection, think about it.</p>
<p>Visit the past. History is full of stories and ideas that might match or contradict yours.</p>
<h2 id="8-when-in-doubt-tidy-up">8. When in Doubt, Tidy Up</h2>
<p><strong>Criticism against the up and productivity movement:</strong> creativity is not equal to productivity. Sometimes you&#39;re very creative while not being productive. Creativity is about making connections, and it&#39;s hard to make them by siloing everything. New ideas are formed by interesting juxtapositions.</p>
<h2 id="9-demons-hate-fresh-air">9. Demons Hate Fresh Air</h2>
<p>Get some fresh air whenever you can. Morning walks are powerful. They are good for though, disconnection, and health.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walking is a way to find possibility in your life when there doesn&#39;t seem to be any left.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="10-plant-your-garden">10. Plant Your Garden</h2>
<p>Just as the plants in a forest, we also have our seasons of creativity. Sometimes it&#39;s better to collect than create. This too shall pass!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Worry less about getting things done. Worry more about things worth doing. Worry less about being a great artist. Worry more about being a good human being who makes art. Worry less about making a mark. Worry more about leaving things better than you found them.</p>

        <link href="https://altay.wtf/books/the-new-corporation"/>
        <updated>2020-12-11T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Corporation's freedom detracts from our freedom, and it's a zero-sum game.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, half of the Americans can&#39;t pay an unexpected 400$ bill without going into debt or selling their possessions.</p>
<p>Despite medical technology advancements, deaths of despair (alcohol, drugs, suicide) are also all-time high.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-the-new-corporation">Chapter 1: The New Corporation</h2>
<p>Joel&#39;s impressions from 2019 Davos Economic Forum. Many tech-corporation leaders believe the current system is not viable, and we need to change it.</p>
<p>Klaus Schwab (the founder of the World Economic Forum and host of Davos) thinks the current &quot;neoliberal market&quot; is going down, and we need a new system called &quot;stakeholder capitalism.&quot; It&#39;s a system where companies consider social and environmental values while making decisions.</p>
<p>Many executives attending the meetings in Davos also agree with this idea of the &quot;new corporation.&quot;. A recent poll has shown that 80% of the business leaders in Davos reject Milton Friedman&#39;s premise to put shareholder value on top of everything. They think the business has broader accountability and opportunity in society. The way they speak also reflects the change is happening, and it&#39;s way better than 15-20 years ago.</p>
<p><em>CEO activism</em>: Business is not only business. It&#39;s getting political as leaders are playing an active role in political issues. Corporations also raise their voices against police shootings, LGBTQ rights, women&#39;s rights, and the environment. Some of the 2017 Superbowl ads were denouncing Trump&#39;s polarization. They cheer for anti-globalization.</p>
<p>_Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): _ is starting to emerge since 2005. It&#39;s about embedding social and environmental values into the operation. &quot;CSR is within the purpose&quot; of the new corporation movement. Profit is a result, but the purpose is the process of getting there.</p>
<p>However, Schwab also warmly welcomed Trump into the stage and presumed his disastrous tax bill would help businesses since it reduces the tax amount. Yet, it&#39;s against Klaus&#39;s ultimate goal of fixing the system.</p>
<p>While the tax reform was happening in 2017, even the &quot;new&quot; corporations lobbied for more cuts. Therefore, it&#39;s not a surprise for Schwab to thank Trump nor the business leaders to support his economic policies.</p>
<p>Pandemic shows how tax avoidance and cuts harm society by debilitating the quality of public health care. &quot;Revenue-starved&quot; public systems are inadequate to protect citizen&#39;s health and wellbeing. It shows corporations only care about CSRs when they don&#39;t lose profits and make more money for the shareholders.</p>
<h3 id="doing-well-while-doing-good">Doing Well While Doing Good</h3>
<p>The key concept should be &quot;doing well while doing good.&quot; Making money through social and environmental issues rather than in spite of them. Electric cars, and similar earth-friendly products, for example.</p>
<p>The modern corporation was invented to raise money for growing industrial ventures (railways, factories, etc.). Corporate law is fundamentally about capitalism. It&#39;s designed to incentivize investment by promising &quot;best interests&quot; will be benefits for the shareholders.</p>
<h3 id="corporations-and-hockey">Corporations and Hockey</h3>
<p>Hockey is a violent game, where it&#39;s not discouraged for players to avoid physical intensity. They can be tough on the ice but different in real life. All hockey teams play by the same rules and rules profoundly shape their actions. Just like the hockey example, an individual might adopt different values on their personal lives from the institutions they work. Their own lights on every action do not guide them.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-still-crazy-after-all-these-years">Chapter 2: Still Crazy After All These Years</h2>
<p>It starts with an interview with Lord Browne, executive chair at L1, who was the chief architect of BP&#39;s safety culture. BP had the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; disaster in 2010. Eleven workers dead and the oil leakage nearly destroyed the Mexican Gulf Ecosystem.</p>
<p>Browne seems to care about safety on a small scale (daily precautions), but they lack preparation for large scale problems such as plant safety. This omission leads to situations where we blindly wait for a disaster to happen.</p>
<p>Many companies promise that they&#39;re taking responsible actions, but the fact shows us they do it as it doesn&#39;t conflict with their interests.</p>
<p>The involvement of hydrocarbon companies made the Paris Agreement useless since they&#39;ve lightened or removed action points that would make a substantial impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real danger is when CEOs and government officials say they&#39;re taking action when in fact, nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR.</p>
<p>– Greta Thunberg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inevitable result is a rapidly warming planet. Destruction of animal habitats is also bringing animals and humans into closer proximity. That, in turn, increases the chances of humans contracting zootomic infections.</p>
<h3 id="nutritional-promises">Nutritional Promises</h3>
<p>The nutritional promises made by corporations are also showing a sign of doing well rather than going good.</p>
<p>The beverages produced by Coca-Cola, Nestle, and Unilever are claimed to help efficiently take the required nutrients, especially for people in poverty. However, each drink&#39;s serving contains roughly the entire maximum sugar intake per day recommended by the World Health Organization.</p>
<h3 id="doing-well-by-doing-bad">Doing Well by Doing Bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Volkswagen and the defeat device.</li>
<li>Johnson&amp;Johnson and the medicines that contain harmful nickel/chromium particles.</li>
<li>BP&#39;s and the Deepwater Horizon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Breaking the law for the sake of generating more revenue has become a typical pattern. After all, it&#39;s a basic calculus. Most profit-oriented corporations don&#39;t hesitate to pay fines for their harmful actions, as long as those actions contribute to their wellbeing.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Independent from the outcome, the act of writing turns out to be the best part.<br>It&#39;s like discovering that you needed a tea ceremony instead of the tea itself. The process itself is the reward, not the outcome.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-writing">Part 1: Writing</h2>
<p>Where to start?</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell the truth</li>
<li>Childhood memories</li>
<li>Big events, gatherings, including every detail that you can remember.</li>
</ul>
<p>You sit down at the same the every day, kick your subconscious, and hold an imaginary gun to your head to make yourself stay at the desk.</p>
<p>The obsession -of looking at your own writing- may keep you awake, or the self loathing may cause you to fall into a narcoleptic coma before dinner.</p>
<p>To some of us, books are as important as anything else in the world. They are full of things we don&#39;t get in real life. They make us understand what&#39;s up with the world, and teach us how to live and die.</p>
<h3 id="short-assignments">Short assignments</h3>
<p>&quot;Take it bird by bird&quot;. The story of Anne&#39;s brothers&#39; 3-month long assignment due next day. Her father was a writer and his suggestion was to take the book of birds in small chunks.</p>
<p>Use a frame to narrow down your perspective. You don&#39;t have to solve every problem. You need to see &quot;just as far as your headlights, while you are driving at night.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="shitty-first-drafts">Shitty first drafts</h3>
<p>Almost all good writing begins with a terrible first draft. You need to start at some point. Facing the blank page is a universal constant.</p>
<p>In your first draft, just write down everything you want, no rules nor judgment. No-one will see it. You can do the editing in the next day. Then it becomes the second draft. You try to say what you say more accurately in your second draft. Then the third one comes, it&#39;s the &quot;dental&quot; draft, which you check every tooth.</p>
<p>Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life. It&#39;s the main obstacle between you and your first draft.</p>
<p>Writing a first draft is very much like watching a polaroid develop. You can&#39;t know what the picture is going to look like until it finishes developing.</p>
<p>Developing a character:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would they behave?</li>
<li>What words would they use while telling a story?</li>
<li>What holds the ectoplasm together? What are this person&#39;s routines, beliefs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagining your characters playing on a movie is a good way to create vivid and continuous dreams.</p>
<p>Drama is the way of holding the reader&#39;s attention. Setup (meet and greet), buildup (stuff happens), and payoff (answers the questions).</p>
<p>For the climax, there must be a healing (union, reclamation), killing (real or fake), or a domination.</p>
<p>Alice Adams&#39;s short story formula:</p>
<ul>
<li>Action: compelling, we want to know more.</li>
<li>Background: what was going before. how they came together?</li>
<li>Development: develop characters, tell what they care about.</li>
<li>Climax: things became different for the main characters.</li>
<li>Ending: what they are left with, who are they now?</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips for writing dialogs that resonate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound your words – read them out loud. Listen and learn how &quot;real&quot; people talk, and make your dialogs sound natural.</li>
<li>Remember that you should be able to identify each character by what they say. They should sound like themselves, not like you.</li>
<li>An helpful way to develop the identity: put two characters who avoid each other into an elevator. Then let the elevator get stuck. Supercharged atmospheres gets the thing going.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You must learn from people from people, not from what you read. The readings should confirm what you observed.</strong></p>
<h2 id="part-2-the-writing-frame">Part 2: The Writing Frame</h2>
<p>Writing is all about learning to pay attention and to communicate what&#39;s going on. Non-judgmental and deep observation is the key to develop a good practice of the writing a frame.</p>
<p>Your writings should carry a piece of essence of your values. If you don&#39;t believe in what you&#39;re saying, then there&#39;s no point in saying it.</p>
<p>Listen to your inner brocoli. As Seth Godin also says in <a href="https://altay.wtf/books/the-practice">The Practice</a>, the traditional way to deal with sceptic thoughts is to shut them down. It leads to a lack of self-esteem on us, and we lose our voice. We, however, should listen to our inner brocoli instead of oppressing the mind.</p>
<p>Writing is about hypnotizing yourself into believing in yourself, getting some work done, then dehypnotizing yourself and going over the material coldly.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-help-along-the-way">Part 3: Help Along The Way</h2>
<p>One of the worst feelings in the world is to forget something on your mind even though you were sure you would remember it when you get back home. But you don&#39;t. It&#39;s hard to accept this humiliating defeat against a problem which you know a perfect solution: taking notes.</p>
<p>Call people for research (Anne&#39;s wine depot story).</p>
<h3 id="writing-groups">Writing groups</h3>
<p>It&#39;s good to gather with a group with the same intentions for peer review and motivation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writers tend to be so paranoid about talking about their work because no one, including us, really understands how it works. But it can help a great deal if you have someone you can call when you need a pep talk, someone you have learned to trust, someone who is honest and generous and who won’t jinx you. When you’re feeling low, you don’t want anyone even to joke that you may be in some kind of astrological strike zone where you’ll be for the next seven years. On a bad day you also don’t need a lot of advice. You just need a little empathy and affirmation. You need to feel once again that other people have confidence in you. The members of your writing group can often offer just that.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-writers-block">The writer&#39;s block</h3>
<p>It&#39;s not a block, no one is preventing you from the act of writing. It&#39;s emptiness. Not being able to find ideas to put on paper. Acceptance is a constructive way to deal with it. Just take a break?</p>
<p>Everything you need is in your head and memories, in all that your senses provide, in all that you&#39;ve seen and thought and absorbed. There in your unconscious, where the real creation goes on.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you better get some fresh air. Your unconscious can&#39;t work when you are breathing down its neck.</p>
<h2 id="part-4-publications-and-other-reasons-to-write">Part 4: Publications and Other Reasons To Write</h2>
<p><strong>Writing as a present.</strong> Anne wrote two of her books as a present to close people in her life who were going to die. They both got the chance of reading them before they die, knowing that it&#39;ll be a part of their immortality. Another motivation was to write those memoirs to help people who are going through simulator situations.</p>
<p>The function of freedom is to free someone else. IF you are no longer wracked, tell your story. Risk freeing someone else. But take out the self-indulgent parts after the first draft.</p>
<p>The truth of your experience can only come through in your own voice. You can&#39;t write ot of someone elses dark place.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t find your dark places if you don&#39;t face with the suffering. We don&#39;t have much truth to express unless we stop avoiding anger, grief, and damage.</p>
<h3 id="finding-voice">Finding voice</h3>
<p>Borrowing some till you find your own is OK. But remember that your truths are true only if you say with your own voice.</p>
<h3 id="giving">Giving</h3>
<p>Resonates with &quot;generosity&quot; in <a href="https://altay.wtf/books/the-practice">The Practice</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no cosmic importance to getting something published, but there is in learning to be a giver. Giving is going to be it&#39;s own reward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Publication or awards should not be the primary reason for writing. If you were not enough the gold medal, you won&#39;t be enough with it.</p>
<h2 id="part-5-the-last-class">Part 5: The Last Class</h2>
<p>Recommendations on repeat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write about your childhood</li>
<li>Write about the challenging periods of your life, when you felt things so deeply.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t be afraid of your material or your past. Be afraid of wasting anymore time how you look and how people see you. Be afraid of not getting your work done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Becoming a writer can change your life as a reader. You will read with a deeper appreciation and concentration, knowing how hard writing is.</p>
<p>Why do I write?</p>
<ul>
<li>Empathy</li>
<li>Share my experience</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The society to which we belong seems to be dying. I don&#39;t mean to sound dramatic, but clearly the dark side is rising.</p>
</blockquote>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The practice requires you to seek out experience of uncertainty to place yourself in a room where you will create discomfort.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Post-industrialist teachings of Seth are here to awaken us one more time.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-trust-yourself">Part 1: Trust Yourself</h2>
<p>The industrial system brainwashed us demands that we do what we&#39;ve been told to follow, then focus on the outcomes. Keep walking on the way of consumption and obedience. It&#39;s all about guaranteed productivity in exchange of soul-consuming labor.</p>
<p>The new practice is about following your own path defined by resilience and generosity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s better to follow your own path, however imperfectly, than to follow someone elses perfectly.</p>
<p>– Bharagavad-Gita</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people who found their voice and made something share a common value: trusting themselves. The original title of the book was <em>Trust Yourself</em>, then it changes as <em>The Practice.</em></p>
<h3 id="askida-ekmek-reference">&quot;Askida ekmek&quot; reference</h3>
<p>When you choose to produce creative work, you are solving a problem. The solution is not just for you, but for those who will encounter with what you face.</p>
<p>The process beings with starting – not finishing, throwing – not catching, improving – not being perfect.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no correct answer, the real deal is the process. It&#39;s the journey that worts the effort.</p>
<p>Art is what we call it when we&#39;re able to create something new that changes someone.</p>
<h3 id="convincing-yourself">Convincing yourself</h3>
<p>If we believe that it&#39;s not our turn, that we&#39;re not talented enough, we&#39;ll do whatever we can do to convince ourselves. Those stories would originate from our past insecurities.</p>
<p><strong>We become what we do.</strong> If you want to change the story, change your actions to rework the narrative.</p>
<h4 id="the-flow">The Flow</h4>
<p>Conditioning ourselves to start working without the flow would make it more likely to arrive.</p>
<p>Flow is a symptom of the work, not the cause of it.</p>
<h3 id="worlds-worst-boss">World&#39;s worst boss</h3>
<p>Is yourself! Trust, and raise the bar over time. Give yourself space on failures.</p>
<p>You would never work for a boss that would treat you as you treat yourself.</p>
<h3 id="the-impostor-syndrome-is-real">The impostor syndrome is real</h3>
<p>It shows what you&#39;re healthy. Most of our daily actions –thus, achievements– our in environments with multiple unknowns. It can be people, market, tech, anything that&#39;s not utterly predictable.</p>
<p>Confidence on outcome would often disappoint. Trust on the process and accepting the outcome is what drives us forward.</p>
<p>Every professional athlete is confident, but nobody wins every game.</p>
<p>Embrace the imposter syndrome instead of trying to make it disappear.</p>
<h3 id="who-you-are-and-what-you-do">Who you are (and what you do)</h3>
<p>If you want to be someone, then just start doing whatever they do.</p>
<p>Once you being, then you are.</p>
<p>Acting is how we acquire the identity.</p>
<h3 id="trust-≠-self-confidence">Trust ≠ Self-Confidence</h3>
<p>Trust is the commitment to the practice. It&#39;s achieved by consistency, making the change happen, going through hard things.</p>
<p>Engaging and trusting in the practice is the best we can do for ourselves.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-generous">Part 2: Generous</h2>
<p>Sounding like everyone is a common way to avoid criticism. But you&#39;re allowed to sound like you. And you should sound like you. Everyone else is taken.</p>
<p>A scarce mindset creates more scarcity. Isolating ourselves from the circle of people who would appreciate our work harms the self-trust and creativity. Creativity is contagious. Go for the abundance.</p>
<p>If you are using outcomes that are out of your control as fuel of your work, it&#39;s inevitable that you will burn out. It&#39;s not a fuel you can replenish, nor burns without residue.</p>
<h3 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h3>
<p>Your work has two audiences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only you. It&#39;s not professional work, there&#39;s no one to serve.</li>
<li>Shipping for someone. Requires to develop empathy through generosity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pursuing either is fine, both is a recipe for unhappiness because you&#39;re insisting other people to see what you see.</p>
<h3 id="three-definitions-of-quality">Three definitions of quality</h3>
<ol>
<li>Meets the spec, has strict tolerances.</li>
<li>Luxury. The cost of material used, the sum of ingredients that brings us status.</li>
<li>Creative magic!? Hard to explain without experiencing it.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-often-do-you-recommend-a-competitor">How often do you recommend a competitor?</h3>
<p>Authors, for example, know abundance in their field would fuel their creative work. They also embrace the idea that their work is not for everyone, and there are alternatives. The ability to suggest an alternative is a sign of generosity.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-the-professional">Part 3: The Professional</h2>
<p>The time we spend worrying is actually time we&#39;re spending trying to control something that is not in our control.</p>
<p>Time invested in something that is within our control is called work. That&#39;s where our most productive focus lies.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no mule, ghost or genie. The practice is choice + skill + attitude. We can learn it and do it again.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t ship the work because we&#39;re creative. We&#39;re creative because we ship the work.</p>
<p>You manage to find an hour every day to watch Netflix, eat, and bathe. Show us your hour spent on the practice. You already know what to do to be creative. You&#39;ve already done it before, at least once. The practice asks you to commit to a process to repeat what you&#39;ve done.</p>
<h3 id="generous-doesnt-mean-free">Generous doesn&#39;t mean free</h3>
<p>Money supports our commitment to the practice, and it&#39;s how our society signifies enrollment.</p>
<p>The person who paid for your scarce time and output is more likely to value, share, and take it seriously.</p>
<h3 id="better-clients-demand-better-work">Better clients demand better work</h3>
<p>Better clients demand better work. Better clients want you to push the envelope, win awards, and challenge their expectations. Better clients pay on time. Better clients talk about you and your work. But finding better clients isn’t easy, partly because we don’t trust ourselves enough to imagine that we deserve them.</p>
<p>You earn better clients by becoming the sort of professional that better clients want. It’s lonely and difficult work. It’s juggling—throw and throw, and one day, the catching will take care of itself.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Living well does not mean avoiding suffering; it means suffering for the right reasons.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s one of the books you would read in a couple of days but needs a lifetime to absorb. I&#39;ve read the first book –The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck– of the series last year, but it didn&#39;t make the same impact as this one. I presume it&#39;s because of my lack of internalization. This one has been on my to-read list since it came out, but the actual trigger was a random retweet. First, it led me to Mark&#39;s blog. I think it was the first time I&#39;ve spent two hours on a website that contains no-bullshit material. Then I skimmed my highlights on the first book, and they made much more sense. There&#39;s also <a href="https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck">a great post</a> that summarizes the point of it. This book, however, is a next-level guidance to tame your existential crisis. It brings up many uncomfortable truths that we try to avoid in our daily lives and offers guidance on dealing with them. As Mark says, &quot;Pain is the universal constant of life.&quot; We can either choose to suffer from it or grow by experiencing and eliminating it.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-hope">Part 1: Hope</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One day, you and everyone you love will die. And beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, little of what you say or do will ever matter. This is the Uncomfortable Truth of life. And everything you think or do is but an elaborate avoidance of it. We are inconsequential cosmic dust, bumping and milling about on a tiny blue speck. We imagine our own importance. We invent our purpose—we are nothing. Enjoy your fucking coffee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We care about what&#39;s going on around us because deep down, we need to feel a sense of importance to avoid the uncomfortable truth. Projecting that sense of importance onto the world around us gives us hope. Without hope for a better future, we will start feeling meaningless.</p>
<p>To build and maintain hope, we need three things: a sense of control, a belief in the value of something, and a community.</p>
<p>&quot;Control&quot; means we feel as though we&#39;re in control of our own life, that we can affect our fate.</p>
<p>&quot;Values&quot; means we find something important enough to work toward, something better, that&#39;s worth striving for.</p>
<p>And &quot;community&quot; means we are part of a group that values the same things we do and is working toward achieving those things.</p>
<h3 id="self-control-is-an-illusion">Self-control is an illusion</h3>
<p>Over the years, we developed a classical assumption to interpret human behavior. If you are organized and successful, that means you can control your emotions and focus on work instead of binge watching or abusing video games. That means emotions cause all our problems and swooping them up would clean up the mess.</p>
<p>The book goes through <em>Elliot</em>&#39;s story, the man who had a brain tumor, and the removal of it destroyed his life. The operation harmed the part which makes us emotional creatures. Without emotions, we lose the sense of empathy, and ability to judge our actions on the road to <em>something better.</em></p>
<p>The fact is that we require more than will-power to achieve self-control. It turns out that our emotions are instrumental in our decision making and actions. We just don&#39;t always realize it.</p>
<h4 id="feeling-brain-and-thinking-brain">Feeling Brain and Thinking Brain</h4>
<p>Our &quot;consciousness car&quot; has two travelers: a Thinking Brain (conscious thoughts, calculation, reasoning) and a Feeling Brain (desires, impulses, emotions). As opposed to the classical assumption, it turns out our Feeling Brain sits on the driver seat. Thus, we are moved to action only by emotion.</p>
<p>That leads to the simplest and most obvious answer to the timeless question, why don&#39;t we do things we should do?</p>
<p>Because we don&#39;t feel like it.</p>
<p>Self-control is an emotional problem. Even worse news is emotional problems can only have emotional solutions.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Thinking Brain sits in the passenger seat and acts as the navigator. It&#39;s the supporting character, yet it imagines itself as the hero. It can&#39;t control the Feeling Brain, but can suggest shortcuts or more rational choices while taking action.</p>
<h4 id="self-serving-bias">Self-serving bias</h4>
<p>Sometimes the feeling brain takes careless actions based on emotions and feeling brain doesn’t contradict too much because it wants to live. If they can’t get along it leads to a bigger problem that could end up in a total destruction. So the thinking brain justifies bad decisions of the feeling brain, thus we don’t feel bad.</p>
<p><em>I deserve an ice-cream</em> because <em>I worked hard today</em>.</p>
<h4 id="establishing-the-illusion">Establishing the illusion</h4>
<p>An healthy communication between two brains can only be achieved through a sensible bargain. Although the Thinking Brain doesn&#39;t drive the car, it&#39;s the one who draws the map. It&#39;s in charge of interpreting the <em>meaning</em> of our impulses and feelings. It can analyze and challenge them to prepare a better route. At the end of the day, the Feeling Brain needs to believe it&#39;s getting a good deal. It needs to believe it&#39;s worthy of doing logical actions, it deserves to live good experiences instead of a chain of self-destruction.</p>
<h3 id="newtons-law-of-emotions">Newton&#39;s Law of Emotions</h3>
<p>This chapter paints Isaac Newton –who had a lonely and loveless childhood– as the explorer of our inner worlds. Based on his experiences, he comes up with three laws of emotion.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>For every action, there is an equal and opposite emotional reaction.</strong> Our experiences create moral gaps. It leads us to think that we don&#39;t deserve what just happened to us. Both positive and negative. Our Feeling Brain acts toward the experiences that relieve pain hence they are more desirable.</li>
<li><strong>Our self-worth equals the sum of our emotions over time.</strong> When moral gaps persist for a long enough time, they normalize. We surrender and undervalue ourselves as <em>the</em> creep who deserves everything. The opposite applies, and both are narcissistic.</li>
<li><strong>Our identity will stay our identity until a new experience acts against it.</strong> When our Feeling Brain feels something, our Thinking Brain constructs are narrative to explain it. Those narratives stick with us and define us, unless we have experiences that shows the opposite. The only way to change our values is to have experiences <em>contrary</em> to our values. This is why there&#39;s no such thing as change without pain, no growth without discomfort.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-to-make-all-your-dreams-come-true">How to make all your dreams come true</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we are creating a religion. Then we drain the fuck out of the people who believe in it. Sounds familiar?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sell hope to the hopeless.</strong> Promise ambitions outcomes to the people living in hopeless conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Choose your faith.</strong> There are three types of religions.<ul>
<li><strong>Spiritual:</strong> supernatural beliefs, high risk / high reward, lifetime / afterlife.<ul>
<li>Hope: a better next life. This world and life is fucked, so we better behave and deserve a better place (heaven, reincarnation) after we die.</li>
<li>They were popular because 99% of the population had no hope, till recently.</li>
<li>They last very long hence supernatural beliefs can never be proven or disproven.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ideological:</strong> natural world, scoped to this life, sets the trends for the decades.<ul>
<li>They find an an explanation on why everything is fucked, and create a solution for it.</li>
<li>If we adopt certain values, our lives in this world will be better.</li>
<li>They are testable and verifiable in small specimen. But still rely on faith since it&#39;s hard to adopt &quot;vegan-ism&quot; all around the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interpersonal:</strong> from a person, or group of people.<ul>
<li>&quot;Every Sunday, millions of people come together to stare an empty field. The field has white lines painted around it.&quot;</li>
<li>Celebrity fandom, sports, politics, relationships are forms of interpersonal religion.</li>
<li>It brings the belief of &quot;some other person will bring us salvation and happiness.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Preemptively invalidate all criticism or outside questioning.</strong><ul>
<li>Find a common enemy and polarize society based on their beliefs. You are either one-of-us or one-of-them.<ul>
<li>&quot;If you don&#39;t support the war, then you are terrorist!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;If you don&#39;t support capitalism, then you are a communist!&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Common enemies create unification.</li>
<li>Fighting with them gives us hope.</li>
<li>Those &quot;who get it&quot; will save the world, those &quot;who don&#39;t get it&quot; will destroy it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ritual sacrifice for dummies.</strong><ul>
<li>Rituals connect people who believe in same religion.</li>
<li>Most of them are developed for alleviation of guilt.</li>
<li><strong>You exist!</strong>, and have to be grateful for someone and look for a way to make your existence meaningful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Promise heaven, deliver hell.</strong><ul>
<li>The more religion promises salvation, enlightenment, and other rewards, the more people feel guilty. What did they to deserve all this!? Then there comes the cycle of psychological abuse.</li>
<li>The pain never ends! If everything were perfect and great, there&#39;d be no reason to follow anybody. No religion will ever make you feel and peaceful all the time. No country will ever feel completely fair and safe...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Prophet for the profit.</strong><ul>
<li>Now that you have followers, it&#39;s time to abuse them. Just say the word and you have what you want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-paradox-of-god-value">The paradox of god value</h4>
<p>Every religion has a god value at the top of its value hierarchy. It is the lens through which people interpret all other values. The believers view all other things through the prism of the god value. They will only be respected and loved if they live according to it. It can be money, freedom, love, or even themselves.</p>
<p>As the religion grows, it goes through a shift on its god value. Instead of solving problems and support the process, it focusses on maintaining the status quo. The god value becomes maintaining the power. This is the moment we lift our heads up and wave the fancy dressed gentlemen entering through the door: Mr. Corruption.</p>
<h3 id="hope-is-fucked">Hope is fucked</h3>
<p>This chapter builds up based on Nietzsche&#39;s master/slave moralities, &quot;amor fati&quot;, and Superman.</p>
<p><strong>Master morality is based upon strength</strong>: I deserve to be rich and powerful because I worked my ass of. It&#39;s the intrinsic desire to create moral gaps between me and the world around me. And I&#39;m on top. (Right wing)</p>
<p><strong>Slave morality is based upon weakness:</strong> I deserve to be threated the best because I suffer. Intrinsic desire to create equal conditions to alleviate suffering. (Left wing)</p>
<p>Both are fundamental parts of our Feeling Brain.</p>
<p>Religions are build on top of those moralities, and they&#39;ve created conflicts throughout the history. However, not having evident proofs to show they are actually working makes them &quot;distrustful.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="god-is-dead">God is dead</h4>
<p>Then something happened around the 17th century. Humanity discovered the best religion of all time. It&#39;s evidence based, open to everybody, and can improve upon itself. It&#39;s called science, and its god value is evidence.</p>
<p>Nietzsche foresaw the technological improvements will stop blindly worshipping a supernatural power –the old friend, god. Eventually, each of us become a god on our own hence we have power to create. This, however, leads to nothing but repetitive confrontations of the uncomfortable truth. This makes us unhappy, crave for more power, and be a warmonger.</p>
<p>That&#39;s what Zarathustra meant by <em>&quot;God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?&quot;</em></p>
<p>No matter what they&#39;re based on, religious beliefs will conflict unless they destroy each other. Each destruction will lead to creation of new religions. But new religions are not created by <em>the god</em>, nor they are for <em>the god</em>. They are between gods, and gods are us.</p>
<h4 id="yes-hope-is-fucked-long-live-amor-fati">Yes, hope is fucked. Long live &quot;amor fati.&quot;</h4>
<p><strong>Hope is fucked</strong>, because it&#39;s exactly what destroys the world. Hope is not only the driver for good ideologies. Nazis also have hope, communists as well. Presence of hope would create nothing but conflicts among the communities. Therefore, hope is destructive.</p>
<p>Nietzsche believed we must look beyond hope, beyond or values, beyond good and evil. And start with &quot;amor fati&quot;, the unconditional acceptance of all life and experience. Experience of high and low, experience of meaningful and dull.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hope for nothing.</li>
<li>Hope for the suffering that comes with freedom.</li>
<li>Hope for the pain comes from happiness.</li>
<li>Hope for the wisdom comes from ignorance.</li>
<li>Hope for the power comes from surrender.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then act despite it.</p>
<p>This is our challenge, our calling: to act without hope. To not hope for better. To be better. In this moment, and the next.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is fucked. And hope is both the cause and the effect of that fuckedness.</strong></p>
<p>The uncomfortable truth can both prison, or set you free. It&#39;s up to you how you interpret and act accordingly.</p>
<ul>
<li>We and everyone we know will die.</li>
<li>Nothing we do will matter on a cosmic scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s no reason not to be kind, respectful, and work to make progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man is a bridge between a beast and a superman. <br>I love those who do not know how to live. For the ones who cross over.</p>
<p>– Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="part-2-everything-is-fucked">Part 2: Everything is Fucked</h2>
<p>Immanuel Kant was living the productivity hacker&#39;s wet dream. He had a punctual schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 -&gt; 8 wake up and write</li>
<li>8 -&gt; 12 teach at uni</li>
<li>13 lunch</li>
<li>13 -&gt; 15 walk through the same way to get back to home</li>
</ul>
<p>He was an intellectual powerhouse. He didn&#39;t give a fuck about hope. His work is a product of pure logic and reason. He reinvented moral philosophy from top the bottom, and influenced a lot of changes in history.</p>
<p>To understand Kant, we need to understand maturity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Children act on pure pleasure</li>
<li>Adolescents follow a set of principles to reach to a pleasure</li>
<li>Adults follow principles no matter the outcome is</li>
</ul>
<p>Maturity is acting by values without expecting anything in return. You are honest because you value honesty, not because you&#39;re afraid of punishment. What matters are a person&#39;s intentions.</p>
<h3 id="parenting-101">Parenting 101</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Parenting is basically following kids around for several decades to make sure they don&#39;t accidentally kill themselves.</p>
<p>– A friend of Mark</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teach your children life is more complicated than their impulses and desires. Learning this in adulthood is much more painful and hard to cope with. Acceptation of not getting everything you want and not being at the center of the universe.</p>
<p>Bargaining (if-this-then-that) is the adolescent mindset. They shape up their values based on getting good at bargaining so they&#39;ll get what they want.</p>
<p>Adults adopt unconditional values. Best way to teach someone is to lead by example. Trust, respect, and love unconditionally. They&#39;ll understand the value when they&#39;re ready.</p>
<p>Parents and teachers fail to make this happen as they too, are in the bargaining mindset. Especially when they are in relationships raise upon mutual benefit and selfishness.</p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/everything-is-fucked/who-cares-what.jpeg" alt="A matrix of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood"></p>
<h3 id="kants-formula-of-humanity">Kant&#39;s Formula of Humanity</h3>
<p>Consciousness is what distinguishes humans from other living creatures.</p>
<p>Our conscious helps us to understand the nature, overcome complexities, and create even more complex systems.</p>
<p>The most fundamental moral duty for every <em>mature</em> human being should be the preservation and growth of the collective conscious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, by no other means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t manipulate, treat, enslave people just because you&#39;ll gain something at the end.</p>
<p>Unlike any other moral systems or codes, the formula of humanity does not rely on hope.</p>
<ul>
<li>The only logical way to improve the world is through improving ourselves by growing up and being more virtuous.</li>
<li>Your ability to be honest, respectful, caring against yourself will also improve how you interact with others and influence them to do the same.</li>
<li>Dignity and respect over all religions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pain-is-the-universal-constant">Pain is the universal constant</h3>
<p>Our emotional reactions to problems are not determined by the size of them. Rather, our minds minimize or amplify our problems to the scale of stress we expect to experience.</p>
<p>Protecting people from adversity doesn&#39;t make them happier. It just makes them more insecure.</p>
<h4 id="the-blue-dot-effect">The Blue Dot Effect</h4>
<p>Blue-purple dots experiment. Participants are asked to choose blue dots in a screen which shows dots within a blue-purple spectrum. As experiment started to show less blue dots, people tend to interpret purple-ish colors as blue. Because they were looking for blue dots.</p>
<p>The more we look for threats, the more we&#39;ll see them regardless of how safe or comfortable our environment actually is.</p>
<h4 id="anti-fragile">Anti-fragile</h4>
<p>Mark suggests to adapt an anti-fragile system discussed by Nasim Taleb. There are fragile and robust systems, which show breaking or resilient behavior against the troubles that they experience. However, an anti-fragile gains from stressors and external pressures: what doesn&#39;t kill us makes us stronger.</p>
<p>Pain avoidance makes us more fragile, learning from pains adapting ourselves to live in a world with more of them makes us more anti-fragile.</p>
<h4 id="actual-buddhist-meditation">Actual buddhist meditation</h4>
<p>Story of Thich Quang Duc, who set himself on fire and not even raised an eyebrow. Who didn&#39;t have access for fancy apps to install and go after the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no end, or getting good at meditation. It&#39;s training your mind for anti-fragility. Sit, observe and sustain the never ending flow of pain, and don&#39;t let &quot;self&quot; to get sucked away.</p>
<p>Since pain is the universal constant of life, the opportunity to grow from pain is also a constant in life.</p>
<p>Pain is the source of all value. It&#39;s always there. We can choose to suffer from it, by avoiding and pursuing happiness. Or we can choose to grow by using it, by facing, experiencing and getting anti-fragile.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beasts of England beasts of Ireland, Beasts of every land and clime, Hearken to my joyful tidings, Of the golden future time.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I always wanted to read George Orwell in the original language, and now I regret not doing it a long time ago.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mayor pig has a dream! Animals take over the control of the farm and liberate themselves from the common enemy: humans. All animals will be equal, and they will never make the mistakes humans did.</p>
<p>Mayor pig dies, but the rest of the farm prepares for the rebellion. Meanwhile, Mr. Jones is an alcoholic who gets one step closer to bankruptcy every day. His lack of control makes the revolution possible; Manner Farm is now the Animal Farm. It&#39;s run with the greatest commandments of Animalism:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whatever goes on two legs are the enemy</li>
<li>Whatever goes on for legs or has wings is a friend</li>
<li>No animal shall wear clothes</li>
<li>No animal shall sleep in bed</li>
<li>No animal shall drink alcohol</li>
<li>No animal shall kill other animals</li>
<li>All animals are equal</li>
</ol>
<p>The corruption, however, arises in the very early days with the mystical disappearance of cow&#39;s milk.</p>
<p>Pigs are smart; they can make plans and convince other animals to work hard. Manipulation is effortless when you have many naive sheep and ducks running around on their tiny legs. They can barely learn the first three letters of the alphabet. Pigs take the milk and apples for themselves. It breaks the 7th commandment, but not everyone knows how to read/write; thus, pigs can change the rules as they wish. They use the treat of the common enemy, Jones, to justify their privileges.</p>
<p>We hear the news of more animal rebellions farms around the country. Mr. Jones tries to take the farm back, Battle of the Cowshed emerges. A human and a sheep dies, leader Snowball gets wounded. He honors himself with a medal. Snowball doesn&#39;t get along very well with Napoleon, the other dominant pig.</p>
<p>Napoleon takes nine newborn puppies and raises them to build himself a private army. He uses them to get rid of Snowball to gain absolute power. That what I would call a successful coup. Snowball wanted to build a windmill, and Napoleon was contradicting that idea. Nonetheless, Napoleon also plans to build a windmill. He doesn&#39;t speak out the same promises –abundance and three-day work week– as Snowball, though.</p>
<p>Napoleon starts trading with humans to import necessary material for building the windmill. Pigs and their guards live in the farmhouse now. They also sleep in the beds, while rule four gets rephrased as No Animal Shall Sleep in bed with sheets. Windmill&#39;s construction gets damaged due to the wind. Napoleon claims it was Snowball who did that, who is an agent working for other farms to take down the Animal Farm. He puts a bounty on his head.</p>
<p>Animal Farm goes through scarcity, and windmill construction restarts in the meantime. They hide scarcity from the outside world by filling the barrels with sand and claiming that they are all full of grains. Hard-worker Boxer wakes up earlier to help more. Due to the new trade agreement, the hen needs to deliver four-hundred eggs per week now. A protest emerges in the hen, results in a slaughter. Napoleon also executes some pigs because they are also agents like Snowball. &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is banned because the rebellion is completed.</p>
<p>There is a pile of logs nearby the farm, Fredrick (one of the two nearby farms mentioned in the book) purchases it from Animal Farm. He, however, uses fake money. Then they attack the farm and blow up the windmill construction one more time. Humans backs of eventually, but the result is not great for Animal Farm. Yet Napoleon declares a victory with two days of celebrations. Napoleon discovers and drinks the whiskey in the cellar. He gets a hangover; other pigs think he&#39;s dying but recovers later in the day. They order distillery books, and the fifth commandment gets an update: No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.</p>
<p>Boxer dies. He will always be remembered with, &quot;I will work harder.&quot; Napoleon sends him to a slaughterhouse instead of a veterinarian. Animal Farm has democracy now, with a single candidate immediately gets elected as the president.</p>
<p>Napoleon calls out neighbor farms to have dinner. Other farmers are fascinated by how animals are working more despite the fact they are eating less. Animal Farm is named Manner Farm again. He sits, walks, drinks, wears, talks, looks, and acts like one of them now. It&#39;s hard to tell the difference between pigs and humans.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am committed to acting as ethically as I can while accepting my compulsory participation in a problematic capitalist paradigm.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s an helpful read, but I&#39;m worried the term &quot;creative&quot; might push some potential readers back. I often perceive myself as a ticket machine than a creative as a software engineer working at FinTech. Yet, I found it golden since I&#39;m going through similar mental struggles.</p>
<p>It&#39;s mostly referring to the people working in the tech industry but could reach a broader audience. It&#39;s a great reference for every member of modern society (who is open to change) to become more mindful of their actions.</p>
<p>The author has an empathic and energizing tone that motivates us to come together, educate each other, and take action. I hope <em>The Conscious Creative</em> reaches more people in various industries, especially those who have executive leverage. It could also have a positive side-effect of nudging readers to move to Canada; I browsed for jobs while reading.</p>
<p>The book instills awareness on various topics within the social, economic, and environmental aspects of our time. It helps us to identify our values, acknowledge our position in the industry, and be more proactive in making more considerate decisions.</p>
<p>It&#39;s realistic as well: <strong><em>&quot;Making a shift in our overall impact doesn&#39;t have to involve a radical lifestyle overhaul. Start small.&quot;</em></strong></p>

        <id>https://altay.wtf/books/on-writing-well</id>
        <link href="https://altay.wtf/books/on-writing-well"/>
        <updated>2020-11-22T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An occasional short sentence can carry a tremendous punch.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got the recommendation from <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3375-the-five-programming-books-that-meant-most-to-me">this list of DHH</a>. As a non-native English speaker trying to express himself, I think it&#39;s an enlightening guide. I&#39;m not familiar with American literature. Yet it&#39;s evident that Zinsser is one of the best authors of non-fiction writing. He&#39;s also a wise teacher and an admirable New Yorker.</p>
<p><em>On Writing Well</em> has four main sections: <em>Principles, Methods, Forms,</em> and <em>Attitudes</em>. The first two focuses more on the fundamentals of non-fiction writing. They help to build checklists and take action. The latter two are about shaping identity as a non-fiction writer. They contain many examples, analyses, and advice around the mindset. <em><strong>&quot;I am more interested in the intangibles that produce good writing—confidence, enjoyment, intention, integrity&quot;</strong></em> as he says.</p>
<h2 id="principle-the-transaction">Principle: The Transaction</h2>
<p>Writing is not an art; it&#39;s a craft. You must show up and write every day.</p>
<p>Any writer&#39;s product has to sell is not the subject written about, but who they are. The author&#39;s enthusiasm keeps the reader engaged with the writing.</p>
<p>Humanity and warmth are the two principles that establish personal transaction.</p>
<p>Rewriting is the essence of writing.</p>
<h2 id="principle-simplicity">Principle: Simplicity</h2>
<p>Declutter every element that isn&#39;t contributing to the cause.</p>
<p>The writer should continuously ask, &quot;what am I trying to say,&quot; then look at the writing and ask, &quot;have I said it?&quot;.</p>
<p>An average reader has an attention span of 30 seconds, and there&#39;s a galaxy of distractions to induce a disconnection.</p>
<p>If readers can&#39;t keep up, they blame themselves. Then they try to demystify the sentences and make a guess to move on. They, however, won&#39;t do that for too long.</p>
<h2 id="principle-clutter">Principle: Clutter</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Every profession has its growing arsenal of jargon to throw dust in the eyes of the populace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clutter is the official language used by corporations to hide their mistakes. When an Air Force Missile crashed, it &quot;impacted with the ground prematurely&quot;. When General Motors had a plant shutdown, that was a &quot;volume-related production-schedule adjustment&quot;.</p>
<p>Clutter is the Pentagon&#39;s language calling an invasion a &quot;reinforced protective reaction strike&quot; and justifying its vast budgets on the need for &quot;counterforce deterrence&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-declutter-a-piece-of-writing">How to declutter a piece of writing</h3>
<p>Put brackets to components that are not doing useful work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unnecessary preposition. (order up)</li>
<li>Unnecessary adverb. (smile happily)</li>
<li>Things that weaken the sentence. (a bit)</li>
</ul>
<p>Re-read without the components in brackets. Keep, eliminate, or rewrite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you hanging on to something useless just because you think it&#39;s beautiful?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="principle-style">Principle: Style</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody becomes Thom Wolfe overnight, not even Thom Wolfe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Readers want the person talking to them to sound genuine. They will notice if you are putting on airs.</p>
<p>They are the two most unrealistic demands from a writer but, relax and be confident.</p>
<p>Be yourself. Writing in the first person is the most natural form. Don&#39;t be afraid to say &quot;I&quot;.</p>
<p>They will care about your opinions if you tell them something interesting. Never write anything you wouldn&#39;t comfortably say in a conversation.</p>
<p>If you are not allowed to use &quot;I,&quot; write the first draft with it, then take it out. Yet, avoiding the &quot;I&quot; form is a reflection of the organizational or political tones.</p>
<p>Good writers are visible behind the words. Writing is an act of ego, and you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep yourself going.</p>
<h2 id="principle-audience">Principle: Audience</h2>
<p>You are writing for yourself. Don&#39;t try to visualize the great mass audience. Don&#39;t hesitate to use humor by worrying if the readers will get it.</p>
<h4 id="craft-the-mechanical-act">Craft: The Mechanical Act</h4>
<p>It&#39;s for the reader. Know your tools; keep it simple, so they don&#39;t give up. There&#39;s no excuse for losing readers due to sloppy craft.</p>
<h4 id="attitude-the-creative-act">Attitude: The Creative Act</h4>
<p>It&#39;s who you are, what you say, and how you say it. It&#39;s OK to lose readers due to who you are. You&#39;ll either get along or not.</p>
<h2 id="principle-words">Principle: Words</h2>
<p>Words are the only tools you got. Choose them considerately. If you find yourself writing that someone enjoyed an illness or a business enjoyed going bankrupt, ask your self how much they really did.</p>
<p>Readers read with their eyes, but they hear what you write in their inner ears. Learning synonyms and acronyms would help you to establish a rhythm and alliteration.</p>
<p>An occasional short sentence can carry a tremendous punch. It stays in the readers&#39; ear.</p>
<h2 id="principle-usage">Principle: Usage</h2>
<p>Choose plain words –if they already exist– to express yourself clearly to anyone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t want to give somebody my input and get their feedback, though I would be glad to offer my ideas and hear what they think of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="methods-unity">Methods: Unity</h2>
<p>Unity is the anchor of good writing.</p>
<h4 id="unity-of-pronoun">Unity of pronoun</h4>
<p>You can speak as a first-person, participant, third person, or an observer.</p>
<h4 id="unity-of-tense">Unity of tense</h4>
<p>Don&#39;t switch back and forth too much. Pick the principal tense and make it prominent. If that&#39;s clear, then small switches would be alright.</p>
<h4 id="unity-of-mood">Unity of mood</h4>
<p>Any tone is acceptable. Just don&#39;t mix two or three.</p>
<h4 id="questions-to-ask">Questions to ask</h4>
<p><strong>In what capacity am I going to address the reader?</strong><br>Reporter? Provider of information? Average person?</p>
<p><strong>What pronoun and tense am I going to use?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What style?</strong><br>Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?</p>
<p><strong>What attitude am I going to take toward the material?</strong><br>Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic? Amused?</p>
<p><strong>How much do I want to cover?</strong><br>Don&#39;t feel an obligation to save the world. Think small. Decide what corner of the subject you are going to cover. Just make your point and look for the nearest exit.</p>
<p><strong>What point do I want to make?</strong><br>Every successful piece of nonfiction should leave the readers with one provocative thought that they don&#39;t have before. Not two thoughts, or five - just one. So decide what single point you want to leave in the reader&#39;s mind.</p>
<h2 id="methods-the-lead-and-the-ending">Methods: The Lead and the Ending</h2>
<p>The most important sentence in any article is the first one. Readers want to know –very soon– what&#39;s in for them. Therefore the lead must capture the readers immediately and force them to keep reading. It must cajole them with freshness, or novelty, or paradox, or humor, or surprise, or with an unusual idea, or an interesting fact, or a question. Anything will do, as long as it nudges their curiosity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve often wondered what goes into a hot dog. Now I know, and I wish I didn&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the ending, if you have presented what you got and made your point, then stop. Surprise is the most refreshing element in non-fiction writing. The perfect ending would take readers slightly by surprise and yet seem exactly right.</p>
<p>Tips for ending</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring the story to full circle. Strike at the end an echo of a note that sounded at the beginning.</li>
<li>Use quotation with a sense of finality, humor, or that adds an unexpected closing detail.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="some-general-tips">Some general tips</h4>
<p>Always collect more material than you will use.</p>
<p>Look for material everywhere, not just by reading obvious resources. Our daily landscape is thick with absurd messages; notice them.</p>
<h2 id="methods-bits--pieces">Methods: Bits &amp; Pieces</h2>
<p>Use active verbs unless there is no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb. &quot;Joe saw him&quot; is strong. &quot;He was seen by Joe&quot; is weak. The first is short and precise; it leaves no doubt about who did what.</p>
<p>Most adverbs are unnecessary. You will clutter your sentence and annoy the reader if you choose a verb with a specific meaning and then add an adverb that carries the same purpose. &quot;Effortlessly easy.&quot;</p>
<p>Most adjectives are also unnecessary. Adjectives like &quot;yellow daffodils&quot; and &quot;brownish dirt&quot; add no value to the meaning. If you&#39;re in a part of the country where the dirt is red, feel free to mention red dirt. The adjective that exists solely as a decoration is self-indulgence for the writer and a burden for the reader.</p>
<p>Prune out the small words that qualify how you feel and how you think and what you saw (&quot;a bit,&quot; &quot;a little,&quot; &quot;sort of,&quot; &quot;kind of,&quot; etc.) Don&#39;t say you were a bit confused and sort of tired and a little depressed and somewhat annoyed. There is no need to call someone very methodical. Either he is methodical, or he isn&#39;t.</p>
<h3 id="punctuation">Punctuation</h3>
<p>The Period. If you want to write long sentences, make sure that the sentence is under control from beginning to end, in syntax and punctuation, so that the reader knows where he is at every step of the winding trail. Just like this one! He does this lead by example things a lot.</p>
<p>The Exclamation Point. Don&#39;t use it unless you must to achieve a certain effect. Resist using an exclamation point to notify the reader that you are making a joke or being ironic. They are annoyed by your reminder that this was a comical moment. They are also robbed of the pleasure of finding it funny on their own. Humor is best when achieved by understatement, and there&#39;s nothing subtle about an exclamation point.</p>
<p>The Dash is used in two ways. One is to amplify or justify the second part of the sentence a thought you stated in the first part. &quot;We decided to keep going–it was only 100 miles more and we could get there in time for dinner.&quot; The other use involves two dashes, which set apart a parenthetical though within a longer sentence.</p>
<h3 id="mood-changers">Mood changers</h3>
<p>Learn to alert the reader as soon as possible to any change in mood from the previous sentence. At least a dozen words will do this job for you: &quot;but,&quot; &quot;yet,&quot; &quot;however,&quot; &quot;nevertheless,&quot; &quot;still,&quot; &quot;instead,&quot; &quot;thus,&quot; &quot;therefore,&quot; &quot;meanwhile,&quot; &quot;later,&quot; &quot;today,&quot; &quot;subsequently,&quot; and more.</p>
<p>Many of us were taught that no sentence should begin with &quot;but.&quot; If that&#39;s what you learned, unlearn it–there&#39;s no stronger word at the start. It announces total contrast with what has gone before, and the reader is thereby primed for the change.</p>
<p>If you have too many sentences starting with &quot;but,&quot; switch to &quot;however.&quot; It is, however, a weaker word and needs careful placement. Don&#39;t start or end with &quot;however.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet&quot; does almost the same job as &quot;but,&quot; though its meaning is closer to &quot;nevertheless.&quot; At the beginning of a sentence, either of those words can replace a whole long phrase that summarizes what the reader has just been told. &quot;Despite the fact that all these dangers had been pointed out to him, he decided to go.&quot; -&gt; &quot;Yet he decided to go.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="contractions">Contractions</h3>
<p>Your style will be warmer and truer to your personality if you use contractions like &quot;I&#39;ll&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t&quot; and &quot;can&#39;t.&quot; Only avoid form &quot;I&#39;d&quot;; hence it can mean both &quot;I had&quot; and &quot;I would.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="that-and-which">That and Which</h3>
<p>Always use &quot;that&quot; unless it makes your meaning ambiguous. If your sentence needs a comma to achieve its precise meaning, it probably needs &quot;which.&quot;</p>

        <id>https://altay.wtf/books/the-best-interface-is-no-interface</id>
        <link href="https://altay.wtf/books/the-best-interface-is-no-interface"/>
        <updated>2020-10-19T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our love for the digital interface is out of control, and our obsession is ruining the future of innovation.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am fond of the doze and accuracy of sarcasm in Krishna&#39;s tone, and I&#39;m glad that he joined Google to work on the pain-points he addressed in this book.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a surprise many companies are already implementing some of the things he proposed, and hopefully more to come.</p>
<h2 id="lets-make-an-app">Let&#39;s Make an App!</h2>
<p>During the past decade, no matter what the topic is, we reached to a situation to wisely say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is an app for that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, shipping an app for a problem is might not be the most intuitive way to solve it.</p>
<p>The book has an eye-opening case-study to concretize that thought: <strong>The BMW app and its 13 step process to open the door of a car!</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/the-best-interface-is-no-interface/01.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And the most prominent outcome of this book, <strong>questioning if we desperately need an interface to solve any problem</strong>, shines with a predictably ingenious counter-argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why can&#39;t we just use proximity sensors to automatically open the door when the driver approaches?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="slap-an-interface-on-it">Slap an interface on it!</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How to make a better ______?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Slap an interface on it!</p>
<p>Following the &quot;there is an app for that&quot; mentality, we see this tactic&#39;s application in many things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Massive car consoles with a touch-screen</li>
<li>Fridges with screens so you can tweet from them</li>
<li>Trash cans in the streets of London, telling you about the weather</li>
<li>Restaurants with touch-screen ordering systems</li>
<li>Vending machines that show a huge touch screen instead of what&#39;s behind</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="addiction-ux">Addiction UX</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>more screens -&gt; more ads -&gt; more revenue</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best minds of our generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.</p>
<p>The general goal is to do whatever possible to keep more and more of us logged in wired, dragging us back for more interface time because the more eyeballs, the more money they can sell their ads for; and the happier their shareholders.</p>
<h2 id="distraction">Distraction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The best distracting interface is no distracting interface.™️</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="screen-insomnia">Screen Insomnia</h2>
<p>Several studies show that the amount of blue-light exposure could have side-effects that may even lead up to cancer. In the short-term, it affects melatonin and causes sleep disorders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The backlight from watching 18 episodes of Breaking Bad on Netflix in full brightness in bed is the reason why you can&#39;t sleep. 😇👍</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="principle-1-embrace-typical-processes-instead-of-screens">Principle 1: Embrace Typical Processes Instead of Screens</h2>
<p>Instead of forcing people to run/open/tap their screens, design smart systems that are intuitive and work without any learning curve. Preferably auto-magical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>60 percent of people who stole something during the self-checkout in the UK did that because the scanner didn&#39;t work. They just gave up trying.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="lazy-rectangles">Lazy Rectangles</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t kickstart the solution by just drawing wireframes. Focus on the overall experience.</p>
<h4 id="an-app-to-open-the-trunk-of-my-car">An app to open the trunk of my car</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>📱: Click this button to open the trunk <br>🙍‍♂️: but, my hands are full? <br>🚗: OK! Kick my bumper, and it opens automatically.<br>🙆‍♂️: Shut up and take my money!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="an-app-to-cool-down-the-interior-of-a-car">An app to cool down the interior of a car</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>📱: Click this button to start cooling down your car parked in the middle of a desert. <br>🙍‍♂️: but, I AM AT THE MOVIES WITH MY GF? <br>🚗: OK! I do it automatically by slightly opening the roof when it&#39;s unbearably hot inside. <br>🙆‍♂️: THX! Here&#39;s a bag of money 💰</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="principle-2-leverage-computers-instead-of-serving-them">Principle 2: Leverage Computers Instead of Serving Them</h2>
<p>IBM Blue beat Kasparov in 97&#39; by making a glitchy random choice. IBM stock has raised 3.6% the next day. So, supercomputers were cool back then. They should be even better now, no?</p>
<p>Today, we have much more powerful machines in front of us, but what do they say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your password must be at least 18,770 characters long, and cannot repeat any of your previous 30,689 passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of computers serving us, we try our best to satisfy the weird constraints that are non-intuitive. Okay, I want my account to be secure and safe, but can&#39;t you help me a little bit?</p>
<p>Machines would understand each other better than any input a human being could produce. Let them communicate and resolve our issues auto-magically via signals and sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>OAuth over complicated login flows with cognitive overload.</li>
<li>Easy-to-understand washing machine modes instead of airplane cockpits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="principle-3-adapt-to-individuals">Principle 3: Adapt to Individuals</h2>
<p>We should strive for smart systems that learn from your behaviors and adapt themselves to provide the most effortless experience—dynamically adjusted experiences over constraints.</p>
<h2 id="challanges">Challanges</h2>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>The information access should be limited, ephemeral, preferably within a time interval. Should be forgotten after utilization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be transparent on what you find from there ⬆️ and present options ⬇️ to forget or turn it off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/the-best-interface-is-no-interface/02.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="automatic">Automatic</h3>
<p>It&#39;s not easy to make the whole system in a perfect automation. It&#39;s obvious there are notorious examples like <code>Clippy</code>, but look what <code>Siri</code> can achieve now. The progress is bitterly real but should not scare you.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Our love for the digital interface is out of control, and our obsession with is ruining the future of innovation.</p>
</blockquote>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Byte-size stories from Derek Sivers&#39; experience in the music industry.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a great guide for finding a niche, building an audience, being resourceful, and expanding the network by developing valuable relationships with people.</p>
<h2 id="creative">Creative</h2>
<p><strong>Marketing is the final extension of your art.</strong><br>How you communicate, make it available and all the stories you tell are as much as valuable as creating it.<br>The way you present your art and what people know about it completely changes how they perceive it.</p>
<p>Restrictions will set you free.<br>In case you feel uninspired or unmotivated, try to set some restrictions for your creation.</p>
<p>Story of <a href="https://sive.rs/capt">Captain T&#39;s</a>, UFO music, and <em>confidential</em> demo: One musician friend of Derek.<br>They prepare a package that says <em>CONFIDENTIAL, DO NOT OPEN</em>, and send it to the radio stations of universities.<br>375/500 of them played the album.</p>
<p>Establishing an authentic way of communication based on your style and making them wonder about you is a perfect way to attract fans.</p>
<h2 id="considerate">Considerate</h2>
<p><strong>Marketing just means being considerate.</strong><br>It&#39;s not about shouting people to listen to your music or use your product.<br>It means making yourself easily noticeable to the people who are looking for you.</p>
<p>The essence of marketing is understanding the point of view of other people.<br>It might be hard to let go of your ego and get off the stage, but you must stop focusing on yourself to achieve empathy.</p>
<p><strong>Constantly ask what your audience really wants</strong>, and hear their problems.<br>Understand their expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Considerate communication:</strong> be as succinct as you can.<br>Respect people&#39;s time.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t try to sound big.</strong><br>Be realistic; prove that you are a real person.</p>
<p><strong>Life is like high school.</strong> It&#39;s about popularity and being cool.<br>But you can choose who you want to be and be with people you want to be.</p>
<h2 id="people">People</h2>
<p><strong>Always think how you can help someone.</strong><br>Ask about the hardest part of their job and complaints.<br>There&#39;s always a favor you can do.<br>Give, give, give, and sometimes you receive!</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t be afraid to ask for favors.</strong><br>Maybe they&#39;ll help you instead of watching TV.<br>By making them feel important, you are helping them as well!</p>
<p><strong>Small gifts go a long way.</strong><br>Give them to under-appreciated people.<br>They deserve to know they are doing great.</p>
<p><strong>Persistence is polite.</strong><br>Not giving up might be good advice, but empathize with people if you don&#39;t get a reply.<br>Don&#39;t talk behind their back.<br>Everyone is busy.<br>You are not the center of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t put anyone up on the pedestal.</strong><br>People do business with people they like.<br>Establishing a friendly relationship is more helpful than being terrified of who they are.</p>
<h2 id="industry">Industry</h2>
<p><strong>Be a competent novice, not an expert.</strong><br>If you sense you are becoming an expert, figure out what you love more.<br>You can do anything, but you can&#39;t do everything.</p>
<p>Rejection therapy is an excellent way to overcome the fear of rejection by getting rejected every day.</p>
<h2 id="resourceful">Resourceful</h2>
<p><strong>Impress people with how little you spend.</strong><br>Saying you need a certain expensive tool is a form of avoiding work.<br>Being resourceful shows you can survive.</p>
<p><strong>You can&#39;t act on a vague goal.</strong> Be specific on what you want.<br>When you don&#39;t know the next step, you feel lost and procrastinate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write down everything you know. Include every detail and your philosophy.</li>
<li>Break details into specific ingredients.</li>
<li>Research what you don&#39;t know.</li>
<li>Turn your findings into actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>A good plan wins no matter what happens.</p>
<p>Assume nobody is going to help you. No investors, no heritage, no lottery. It&#39;s all up to you. You can&#39;t wait because there is nobody to wait. When someone does help you, that would make it better.</p>
<p>Be prepared for two scenarios.</p>
<p>The first one depends on nobody but you. There are no lucky breaks. Develop your skills, build your reputation, be small but sustainable.</p>
<p>Second one makes use of the industry to build a good team, pursue deals and find investors.</p>
<p>Prepare for either path, you will win any case.</p>
<p><strong>Extreme results come from extreme actions.</strong> You can&#39;t do what everyone else does. Normal people live a normal life. <a href="https://altay.wtf/notes/why">Find what you love, and let it kill you.</a></p>
<p>Every depressing situation may arise an opportunity. Hungry guy from music industry comes to Derek&#39;s university for a seminar. Derek orders a pizza to the classroom. They became friends after.</p>
<h2 id="describe">Describe</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be succinct.</li>
<li>Make people curious.</li>
<li>Speak everyday language, don&#39;t use weird artsy words.</li>
<li>Use tricks and phrases that worked on you.</li>
<li><a href="https://sive.rs/hillbf">&quot;Hillbilly Flamenco&quot;</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proudly exclude most people.</strong> Blockbuster hits are dead, aim for the niche. Make bold statemens like &quot;if you like Katty Perry, don&#39;t listen to this!&quot;. They will wonder, and listen.</p>
<h2 id="target">Target</h2>
<p><strong>Do the opposite</strong>. If everyone is hyper connected, it&#39;s more valuable to disconnect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when the others are fearful.</p>
<p>— Warren Buffett</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="quantity">Quantity</h2>
<p>Keep a database of people, what they do, where they live, when was your last contact.<br>Stay in touch.<br>Keep the communication personalized.</p>
<ul>
<li>A: 3 weeks</li>
<li>B: 2 months</li>
<li>C: 6 months</li>
<li>D: 12 months</li>
</ul>
<p>Find out what they are doing. Be unselfish and caring. Help them away, show appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>Every breakthrough comes from someone you know.</strong> Meet new people, stay in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Include everyone in your success</strong>.<br>Return the favors.<br>You are not pulled to success by destiny.<br>You are lifted by the people around you.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p><a href="https://altay.wtf/notes/my-utopia">Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.</a></p>
<p>Derek&#39;s pricing for a gig, 2000$/h for an hour, 1500$/h for two hours. &quot;You pay me to get there, I enjoy the rest!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Some people like to pay.</strong> Even if you are operating on a free-pricing plan, let people who want to contribute with their money.</p>
<p><strong>Charging:</strong> overpricing may motivate people to pay more attention.</p>
<p>**Don&#39;t promote until people can take action. **</p>
<p>Are fans telling friends? If no, then keep working.</p>
<p>If yes, don&#39;t promote till they can&#39;t take action. Otherwise it&#39;s a waste of their attention.</p>
<h2 id="mindset">Mindset</h2>
<p><strong>Move to the big city.</strong> Possibilities on the internet are great, but living in New York and Los Angeles helped Derek. <strong>It shows you are in the game.</strong></p>

        <updated>2020-10-17T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As long as we continue to be obsessed with work, work, and more work, the number of superfluous jobs will only continue to grow.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-return-of-the-utopia">The Return of the Utopia</h2>
<p>For roughly 99% of the history, 99% of the humanity was poor, hungry, dirty, afraid, stupid and sick. In the last 200 years, that has been changed.</p>
<p>Average salaries are way higher, and less people die from diseases. Between 1994 and 2014, internet access rate climbed to 40% from 0.4%</p>
<h3 id="medieval-utopia">Medieval Utopia</h3>
<p>If you&#39;ve asked medieval civilizations to describe an utopia, it&#39;ll be something like &quot;Land of Plenty&quot; (Cocknaigne). But we are already in some sort of a land of plenty.</p>
<ul>
<li>7/24 fast food</li>
<li>Climate control</li>
<li>Free love</li>
<li>Workless income</li>
<li>Plastic surgery</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s an era which biblical prophecies came true. Blind people are starting to see. Cripple people are starting to walk.</p>
<p><strong>But it&#39;s a bleak paradise.</strong> There&#39;s a crucial thing we are lacking: a reason to get out of the bed. We stopped making progress, which is the realization of utopias. We can&#39;t imagine a better world because there&#39;s no dream to replace the current state. Children born today will be worse off than their parents.</p>
<p><strong>Two forms of an utopian thought</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Blueprint: strict, controlled, fascist, stalinist, genocidal</li>
<li>Socratic: asking the questions to identify problem in the society. &quot;Why are we working harder since 80&#39; even though we are richer?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problems-of-today">Problems of today</h3>
<h4 id="destruction-of-the-grand-narrative">Destruction of the grand narrative</h4>
<ul>
<li>Food industry supplies unhealthy foods, and we go to the doctor.</li>
<li>Tech creates more jobs, and obsolete people go back to career coaches.</li>
<li>Industry encourages to spend more for happiness, and we end up crying on therapists&#39; shoulders.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-papered-generation">The papered generation</h4>
<p>&quot;You can become everything you want, you are special&quot; mindset brought up a narcissistic diet, and we crash and burn when facing &quot;the big world&quot;. More competition, more unemployment, and more anxiety.</p>
<h4 id="true-progress">True progress</h4>
<p>True progress beings with generating wisdom about what it means to live well.</p>
<ul>
<li>New communities</li>
<li>Less mass media manipulation</li>
<li>Shared idealism to generate value by being useful for the community.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="universal-basic-income">Universal Basic Income</h2>
<p>Several experiments in London and a small town in Canada shown the &quot;basic income&quot; is actually helpful for people to get their shit together and improve their lives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Households put money to good use</li>
<li>Poverty started to decline</li>
<li>There are long term benefits for income, health and tax</li>
<li>Alcohol and tobaco consumption has declined for 82% of the cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="is-it-futile">Is it futile?</h3>
<p>For the first time in the history, we are actually rich.</p>
<p>Eradicating poverty in US would cost 175 billion $, which is less than 1% of GDP and 1/4 of US military spending. Only the Afghanistan and Iraq wars costed $4-$6 trillion.</p>
<p>Approximate comparison applies most of the developed countries.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-dangerous">Is it dangerous?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Artists and writers won&#39;t have to work in day jobs.</li>
<li>People would be unhappy if they don&#39;t work.</li>
<li>It would help involuntary employments to vanish.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-history">Some history</h3>
<p>Raegan was going to pass the law but it came back from the senate, even though the congress approved.</p>
<p>Nixon&#39;s free market enthusiast advisor gives him a 6-page document and it changes his mind. There was a bullshit story from England (Speedhamland) in this document, which tells UBI didn&#39;t work out.</p>
<p>To make sure they solve the &quot;joblessness&quot; situation, he attached the obligatory registration to job center point to his 1600$/m basic income bill. But it didn&#39;t pass.</p>
<p>🥸 <em>MORE IN NOTEBOOK. TRANSITION ONGOING</em> 🥸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to be useful, you can start now. Just put one percent of your vision, and you are in the game.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="your-company-is-your-utopia">Your Company is Your Utopia</h2>
<p>Business is not about money. It&#39;s about making dreams come true for others and yourself.</p>
<p>Starting a company is a great way to improve something and learn while doing.<br><a href="https://altay.wtf/notes/my-utopia">Your company is your little utopia; run it as you&#39;re in charge of your ideal world.</a></p>
<p>A business is a reflection of the creator. Pay attention to what excites you or what drains you.<br>Make your company and role <strong>anything you want</strong>.<br>Don&#39;t aim to grow; don&#39;t aim to drive the busy bandwagon.<br>The real point of doing anything is to be happy, do whatever makes you happy.</p>
<p><strong>How CD Baby became a thing:</strong> Derek solved his problem first, which could be re-used for another person having the same problem. It started as an independent business for independent artists to sell their music online, without waiting for some big label to sign them and do it.</p>
<h2 id="business-plan">Business Plan</h2>
<p>A business plan should not take more than a few hours.</p>
<p>CD Baby just followed the idea of charging 4$ per copy for albums, which was the same as local stores around that time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No business plan survives from initial contact with the customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="hell-yeah-or-no">Hell Yeah Or No</h2>
<p><a href="https://altay.wtf/notes/why">Persistence is undoubtedly essential, but don&#39;t persistently do the wrong thing.</a> Success comes from persistently improving and innovating.</p>
<p>We are all busy. Saying <strong>&quot;hell yeah, or no&quot;</strong> helps choose what to do with enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to be useful, you can start now. Just put one percent of your vision, and you are in the game.</strong></p>
<h2 id="no-investors">No Investors</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t have to please anybody but my customers and myself.<br>By not having any money to waste, you never waste money.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="no-big-clients">No Big Clients</h2>
<p>When you have many small clients instead of several juicy ones, you will be less hurt when they want to leave you.</p>
<p>The cruel fact <strong>you can&#39;t please everyone</strong> will also be easier to accept.</p>
<h2 id="ideas-and-execution">Ideas and Execution</h2>
<p>Ideas are just multipliers for execution.</p>
<p>An awful idea (-1 points) multiplied with brilliant execution (100) would make you waste a hurtful amount of resources. On the other hand, a great idea (100 points) with no execution (0) could also make you earn nothing.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t pretend like there&#39;s only one way to do something.<br>Make N radically different plans.<br>Always have a backup plan.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-are-doing-what-you-are-doing">Why You Are Doing What You Are Doing</h2>
<p>In a perfect world, would you need advertising? Think about this before you eagerly invest in having more people on board.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are people happy?</li>
<li>Are you happy?</li>
<li>Are you profitable?</li>
<li><strong>Isn&#39;t that enough?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I miss the mob. Wall Street MBA&#39;s optimizing everything, and now I need to pay 25 cents for ketchup on my hotdog.&quot;</p>
<p>&mdash; NY Taxi Driver</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-do-you-grade-yourself">How Do You Grade Yourself?</h3>
<ul>
<li>How much money?</li>
<li>How much Trump Towers?</li>
<li>How much people?</li>
<li>How many useful things you create?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="customers-are-always-more-important">Customers are Always More Important</h3>
<p>If problem you are trying to solve is truly solved in a more natural way, business might be no longer needed. You don&#39;t have to get into the survival mode to push for weird things.</p>
<h3 id="act-like-you-dont-need-the-money">Act Like You Don&#39;t Need the Money</h3>
<p>Do it for love, be generous and trustworthy, then the money will come, eventually.</p>
<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>
<p>Be ready to handle at least double the size of customers when it comes to operational stuff.</p>
<h3 id="but-for-real">But, for real...</h3>
<p>In the end, it&#39;s not about what you want to be. It is about what you have. Taking time to learn doing stuff by yourself is actually becoming someone who knows that. <strong>When you sign-up to run a marathon, you don&#39;t want a taxi to take you to the finish line.</strong></p>
<h3 id="promises">Promises</h3>
<p>Never promise a customer doing something beyond your control. The CD Baby and iTunes Store story...</p>
<h2 id="delegating">Delegating</h2>
<p>Aim to make yourself verbose by teaching, documenting, and training people along the philosophy.</p>
<p>Let them take care of the daily problems and onboard new employees.</p>
<p>Move away and spend time on improvements.</p>
<h3 id="delegate-but-dont-abdicate">Delegate, but don&#39;t abdicate</h3>
<p>Too much delegation resulted in a weird situation.<br>Employees get to choose the revenue sharing model.<br>They end up giving all profit to themselves.<br>Fixing it in a conflicting way was the beginning of the end for CD Baby. People&#39;s relationships got broken, and Derek stopped going to the office.</p>
<p>Eventually, he sold CD Baby and donated money to music education, where it all started for him.</p>
<p>A sentimental ending for a great story.</p>

<p>Find people who share the same values as you in a topic, and show the work to them before anyone else.</p>
<p>Do what you can to nurture your relationship.</p>
<h3 id="meet-up-in-meatspace">Meet Up in Meatspace</h3>
<p>Prefer IRL events: coffee, lunch, meetups.</p>
<p>A great activity to do: go to museums or bookstores, so you can browse around if you get bored.</p>
<h2 id="8-learn-to-take-a-punch">8. Learn to Take a Punch</h2>
<p>Austin talks about his acquaintances from the design school.<br>They were too harsh while reviewing each other&#39;s work to see if any of them are going to quit school. 🤡</p>
<p>Put out a lot of work, get punched a lot.</p>
<p>The more criticism you take, the more you realize it is harmless.</p>
<p>Nobody died from a bad review. Take a deep breath and accept whatever comes.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t control the criticism you receive, but you can control how you react to it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, having your work hated by a particular audience might be a badge of honor.</p>
<p>Your work is not your identity. Keep yourself closer to people who like you because of who you are.</p>
<p><strong>Protect your vulnerable areas.</strong> If it&#39;s too sensitive, don&#39;t put it out, but also don&#39;t forget:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compulsive avoidance of embarrassment is a form of suicide.</p>

<p>The worst kind of troll is the one who lives in your head.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="9-sell-out">9. Sell Out</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s write a swimming pool.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ask for money when you are confident and at a fair price.</p>
<h3 id="your-audience">Your Audience</h3>
<p>Keep a mailing list.<br>People who sign-up for your mailing list are giving consent to be &quot;disturbed&quot; by you.<br>Don&#39;t push your chance; don&#39;t turn into human spam.</p>
<p>Interaction with the audience will require more time as it grows; schedule office hours for that.<br>Don&#39;t consume the productive time.</p>
<h3 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h3>
<p>Say &quot;yes&quot; to more kind of work you want to do.<br>Say &quot;no&quot; to less of the things you want to do, even if they have a more significant monetary outcome.</p>
<h2 id="10-stick-around">10. Stick Around</h2>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t quit your show.</strong> The people who get what they are often the ones who just stick around long enough.</p>
<p>Whether you&#39;ve just won big or lost big, you still have to face the next question: <em>what&#39;s next?</em></p>
<h3 id="start-over-begin-again"><del>Start Over</del> Begin Again</h3>
<p>Whenever you feel like whatever there is more to learn about what you&#39;re doing, it&#39;s time to change course to learn something new to move forward.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elm functions are curried, which is the fancy way of saying they take one argument at a time.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/altaywtf/programming-elm">a Github repository</a> for the stuff I built while following this book.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-get-started-with-elm">Chapter 1: Get Started with Elm</h2>
<p>Introduction to the language, and initialization of the example app: <em>Picshare</em></p>
<p>All variables are defined as constants, but REPL allows us to change them for convenience.</p>
<p>Elm is an <em>expression-oriented</em> language. An expression is anything a programming language can evaluate to produce a value. Literals such as strings and numbers, math operators, and calling functions are all expressions in Elm.</p>
<h3 id="branching">Branching</h3>
<p>The <code>if</code> statement is similar to <code>ternary</code> expression in JavaScript. Elm&#39;s <code>if</code> statements have two advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes us to supply an <code>else</code> branch.</li>
<li>It expects all branches to return same type of value.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="partial-application">Partial Application</h3>
<p>Elm functions are <em>curried,</em> which is the <em>fancy way of saying they take one argument at a time.</em></p>
<p>Filling one argument at a time is known as <em>partial application.</em> Calling a function with only some arguments is <em>partially applying it.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create curried functions, partially apply arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>Lists (also records) doesn&#39;t have notion of indices. Lists work by letting each element reference the next element in the list, similar to the links in chain. The language protects us from potential <code>undefined/null</code> values with this approach.</p>
<p>Lists can also include same type of elements.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-create-stateful-elm-applications">Chapter 2: Create Stateful Elm Applications</h2>
<p>Introduction to <em>Elm Architecture:</em> View-Model-Update pattern.</p>
<h3 id="records">Records</h3>
<p>Elm developers typically refer to the entries in a record as <em>fields.</em></p>
<p>Record update syntax <code>newDog = { d | age = dog.age + 1 }</code> differs from <code>Object.assign</code> because it creates a new object each time, where the other lets us merge together different JavaScript objects.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-immutability">Benefits of Immutability</h3>
<ul>
<li>It makes the data flow explicit.</li>
<li>Instances of data structures can share data internally because there is no risk of code accidentally or intentionally mutating the shared data.</li>
<li>In multithread languages, there is no risk of threads mutating the shared data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="custom-types-and-pattern-matching">Custom Types and Pattern Matching</h3>
<p>Elm developers refer to the values of a custom type as <em>constructors.</em></p>
<p>Each branch of a case expression is itself an expression so we don&#39;t need a <code>break</code> statement. <code>_</code> can be used as the wildcard for pattern matching.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">update msg model =
    case msg of
        Like -&gt; { model | liked = True }
      _ =&gt; { model | liked = False }
</code></pre>
<h2 id="chapter-3-refactor-and-enhance-elm-applications">Chapter 3: Refactor and Enhance Elm Applications</h2>
<h3 id="using-type-aliases-as-constructor">Using Type Aliases as Constructor</h3>
<p>Elm also creates a constructor function with the same name as the type alias.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">type alias Model =
    { url : String
    , caption: String
    , liked : Bool
    }

initialModel = Model &quot;https://programming-elm/1.jpg&quot; &quot;Surfing&quot; False
</code></pre>
<h3 id="checking-list-length">Checking List Length</h3>
<p>Pattern matching is more versatile and faster compared to counting elements.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">list = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]

case list of
    [] -&gt;
        text &quot;empty&quot;

    _ -&gt;
        ul [] [(List.map ... list])
</code></pre>
<h2 id="chapter-4-communicate-with-servers">Chapter 4: Communicate with Servers</h2>
<p>JSON decoding with <code>elm-decoders</code>, also uses NoRedInk&#39;s <code>elm-json-decode-pipeline</code> package for the railway.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">type Result error value
    = Ok value
    | Err error
</code></pre>
<h3 id="special-string-syntax-">Special string syntax (&quot;&quot;&quot;)</h3>
<pre><code class="language-elm">myElmPoem =
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Roses are red...
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="http-commands">HTTP commands</h3>
<p>We create the command, but execution is delegated to the Elm Architecture for the sake of purity. Sending commands can be done in the application lifecycle or as a result of a <code>Msg</code> handled in the <code>update</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="safely-handle-null">Safely Handle <code>null</code></h3>
<pre><code class="language-elm">type Maybe a
    = Just a
    | Nothing

type alias Model =
    { photo = Maybe Photo }

case model.photo of
    Just Photo -&gt; &quot;yey!&quot;
    Nothing -&gt; &quot;ney!&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="chapter-5-go-real-time-with-websockets">Chapter 5: Go Real-Time with WebSockets</h2>
<ul>
<li>Started with handling <code>loading</code> and <code>error</code> states for the HTTP request in the UI.</li>
<li>Created a JS-Elm bridge for listening WebSocket events, with <code>ports</code><ul>
<li><code>listen</code> → outgoing ports that return a <code>Cmd</code> → <code>elmApp.ports.subscibe.listen(webSocketHandler)</code></li>
<li><code>receive</code> → incoming ports that return a <code>Sub</code> → <code>socket.onMessage = (e) =&gt; elmApp.ports.receive.send(e.data)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a notification banner to show there are new photos available to be put into the <code>Feed</code>, then an <code>onClick</code> handler to put it into feed from <code>streamQueue</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="backward-composition--operator">Backward Composition (&lt;&lt;) Operator</h3>
<pre><code class="language-elm">WebSocket.receive
    (LoadStreamPhoto &lt;&lt; decodeString photoDecoder)

--- same as ---
WebSocket.receive
    (\ json -&gt; LoadStreamPhoto (decodeString photoDecoder json))
</code></pre>
<h3 id="cons--operator">Cons (::) Operator</h3>
<p>Creates a new list by prepending the left operand to the list on the right.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">oldList = [&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]

newList = &quot;a&quot; :: oldList -- -&gt; [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="chapter-6-build-larger-applications">Chapter 6: Build Larger Applications</h2>
<p>Refactored of the <code>salad-builder</code> app.</p>
<p><strong>Deconstructed <code>view</code> to have multiple functions.</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">view .... everything

viewInput
viewCheckbox
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Simplified messages</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">SelectLettuce
SelectSpinach
SelectSpringMix

--- to ---

type Base = Lettuce | Spinach | SpringMix

SelectBase Base
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Learnt two ways to make <code>model</code> more maintainable:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">type alias Model =
    { building : Bool
    , sending : Bool
    , success : Bool
    , error : Maybe String
    , base : Base
    , toppings : Set String
    , dressing : Dressing
    , name : String
    , email : String
    , phone : String
    }

---- first approach: nested state ----
type alias Salad =
    { base: Base
    , toppings: Set String
    , dressing: Dressing
    }

type alias Model =
    {
        --- view state ---
        salad: Salad
        --- contact details state ---
    }

---- second approach: extensible records ----
type alias Contact c =
    { c
            | name : String
            , email : String
            , phone : String
    }

-- any object can be treated as Contact if it contains the fields --
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Prevented invalid states</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">type alias Model =
    { building : Bool
    , sending : Bool
    , success : Bool
    , error : Maybe String
        -- rest of the state --
    }

--- combined fields ---
type Step
    = Building (Maybe Error)
    | Sending
    | Confirmation

type alias Model =
    {
        step: Step
        -- rest of the state --
    }
</code></pre>
<h2 id="chapter-7-develop-debug-and-deploy-with-powerful-tooling">Chapter 7: Develop, Debug, and Deploy with Powerful Tooling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Usage of <code>Debug.log</code> and <code>Debug.todo</code> with <code>Json.Decode</code> examples.</li>
<li><code>elm reactor</code> and <code>create-elm-app</code></li>
<li>Ported <code>picshare</code> to <code>create-elm-app</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-8-integrate-with-javascript">Chapter 8: Integrate with JavaScript</h2>
<p>Added an Elm powered file uploader to a React application that has three inputs (title, description, images) for a note taking service.</p>
<p>Sent input events from Elm to JS with ports, also received the image list from the source of truth, <code>App</code> component from the JS context, again through ports.</p>
<p>Used <code>Flags</code> for passing data during the initialization step of the Elm app.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9-test-elm-applications">Chapter 9: Test Elm Applications</h2>
<p>Applied TDD while developing a date helper library called <code>awesome-date</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unit tests</strong> isolate and verify the behavior of one small piece of software.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-chasm-between-developer-and-entrepreneur">The Chasm Between Developer and Entrepreneur</h2>
<p>The book is not anti-venture capital but it&#39;s against the dogma of every startup needs VC to proceed or succeed. It tries to narrow down the scope to the two types of entrepreneurs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Micropreneurs:</strong> people who want to remain solo, owns a single product or multiple products.</li>
<li><strong>Bootstrappers:</strong> something larger than a single person venture, perhaps 5-10 employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>A self-funded entrepreneur is a</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical visionary who create softwares for a <strong>niche market,</strong> targeting a <strong>niche audience</strong></li>
<li>Merges existing technical knowledge with online marketing knowledge</li>
<li>Cross between a developer, a webmaster, and a marketer</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have a product idea, but you didn&#39;t do your homework for the market, that means it&#39;s a project, not a product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some random research findings from some random Dominican University reveal the significant contribution of the three factors for achieving goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing them down</strong></li>
<li><strong>Making public commitment</strong> (to friends, or another kind of audience)</li>
<li><strong>Accountability</strong> (reporting the progress in a periodical schedule)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Spend 20 minutes making a list of the things you are hoping to accomplish by starting up. If you believe what was said above, it&#39;ll make a difference. Worst case, you waste 20 minutes of your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One short term recommendation from the author is to build a product that generated 500$/m in profit.</p>
<h3 id="transitioning-from-developer-to-entrepreneur">Transitioning from Developer to Entrepreneur</h3>
<p>There are some realizations we need to face...</p>
<p><strong>Market comes first, marketing second, aesthetic third, and functionality a distant fourth.</strong> In the same market, the product with better marketing wins. Every time.</p>
<p><strong>Things will never be as clear as we want them to be.</strong> Writing code is dry and clean but marketing is about math and human behavior, which is the most hard to master part.</p>
<p><strong>We need to fail fast and recover.</strong> We are going waste money, time, make bad decisions, miss deadlines and release buggy code. Each time this happens, we need to accept that we are failed and move on.</p>
<p><strong>Process is the king!</strong> Documenting repeatable process for anything you will do more than once is essential to your sanity. It also makes it easier to sell the product if you ever consider to exit.</p>
<h2 id="why-niches-are-the-name-of-the-game">Why Niches are the Name of the Game</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can find a small group of people and make them amazingly happy, you will make money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The niche market approach</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires product to be focused on a narrower horizon, design decissions and processes are easier.</li>
<li>Advertising is more cost effective.</li>
<li>Less competition.</li>
<li>Higher profit margin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="brainstorming-niches">Brainstorming Niches</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look at all areas in your life:</strong> hobbies, interests and work experience.</li>
<li><strong>Look at list of occupations.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="evaluating-niches">Evaluating Niches</h3>
<ul>
<li>Estimate your conversion rate, based on the pricing</li>
<li>Examine traffic breakdown (search engines, incoming links, direct traffic, advertising)</li>
<li>Measure the demand based on the traffic estimation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="testing-an-idea-for-under-100">Testing an Idea for Under $100</h3>
<ul>
<li>Build a mini-sales site (home, product tour, pricing, sign-up)</li>
<li>Collect user contact instead of actual product when people press sign-up</li>
<li>Create AdWords campaign and send targeted traffic to the site</li>
<li>Track the CTA impressions, assume the actual conversion rate will be %2-5</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="your-product">Your Product</h2>
<p>The extremely surprising product success triangle:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> your product has to be good</li>
<li><strong>Market:</strong> you need a group of people willing to pay money for it</li>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> you have to market, sell and support it</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-it-estimation">Building It: Estimation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Site map with list of screens</li>
<li>Sketch out how each page will look like</li>
<li>Estimate 4-12 hours per page</li>
<li>Add 10-20 hours for DB design depending on complexity</li>
<li>Estimate back-end functionality such as payment, scheduled tasks etc. Add 10-40 hours each.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the path to 1.0 is between 200 and 400 hours, it&#39;s good. If under 200, take a step back and check if it&#39;s a tool or a full blown application, which provides real value and easier to charge.</p>
<p>If over 400, eliminate the functionality.</p>
<p>There is also landing page, documentation, marketing and etc, which is estimated to take 100-200 hours.</p>
<p>Calculate the sum out, estimate the total duration based on your eligibility to allocate time.</p>
<ul>
<li>15h/w → 300h means 4.5 months</li>
<li>15h/w → 550h means 8.5 months</li>

<p><a href="https://altay.wtf/notes/jakobs-law"><em>Users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar</li>
<li>Leveraging existing mental models would help us to create superior experiences that would flatten the learning curve of our service</li>
<li>When introducing re-designs, prefer gradual transitions between the versions. Allow people to keep using the old version so they can try and adapt without completely leaving the product</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p>Dates back to Jakob Nielsen&#39;s works in 2000. The less mental energy users have to spend learning an interface, the more they can dedicate to achieve their objectives.</p>
<h4 id="psychology-concept-mental-models">Psychology Concept: Mental Models</h4>
<p>A mental model is what we thing we know about a system, especially how it works. We also tend to apply the knowledge when interacting with similar types of systems.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Form elements looking like real-world controls; toggles, radio inputs, buttons.</li>
<li>All e-commerce sites look the same.</li>
<li>Major redesign transition: YouTube allowed people to keep using the old UI for a while.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technique-user-personas">Technique: User Personas</h4>
<p>Using personas would help us to frame design decisions based on the needs of the real audience.</p>
<h4 id="key-consideration-sameness">Key Consideration: Sameness</h4>
<p>This law might sound like it&#39;s enforcing all the websites look the same, which is a completely valid concern. However, we should keep in mind the form should follow function in order to deliver usable stuff. There&#39;s always room for innovation.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Always being with common patterns and conventions, and only depart from them when it makes sense to. If you can make a compelling argument for making something different to improve the core user experience, that&#39;s a good sign that it&#39;s worth exploring.</p>

<h2 id="fittss-law">Fitts&#39;s Law</h2>
<p><em>The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Touch targets should be large enough for users to accurately select them.</li>
<li>Touch targets should have ample spacing between them.</li>
<li>Touch targets should be placed in areas of an interface that allow them to be easily acquired.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="hicks-law">Hick&#39;s Law</h2>
<p><em>The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize choices when response times are critical to increase decision time</li>
<li>Break complex tasks into smaller steps in order to decrease cognitive load</li>
<li>Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting recommended options</li>
<li>Use progressive onboarding to minimize cognitive load for new users</li>
<li>Be careful not to oversimplify the point of abstraction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="origins-1">Origins</h3>
<h4 id="psychology-concept-cognitive-load">Psychology Concept: Cognitive Load</h4>
<p>The amount of resources needed to understand and interact with an interface is known as cognitive load.</p>
<h3 id="examples-1">Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>TV remote controllers with a lot of irrelevant buttons, eventually replaced with simpler versions like Apple TV remote.</li>
<li>Google search showing different types of search options (text, image, etc) after you initiate the search process. Conditionally complicating the UI, similar to filtering the file dropdown actions based on selected file type on Putio.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technique-card-sorting">Technique: Card Sorting</h4>
<p>Can be used to determine which elements are vital for the interface to achieve the expected task</p>
<h4 id="key-consideration-oversimplification">Key Consideration: Oversimplification</h4>
<p>Removing text labels and just leaving icons in order to simplify the interface (iOS bottom tab bar, Facebook example) may lead to confusion for some users.</p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-03.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="millers-law">Miller&#39;s Law</h2>
<p><em>The average person can keep only 7 (+-2) items in their working memory.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that short-term memory capacity will vary per individual, based on the prior knowledge</li>
<li>Organize content into smaller chunks to help users process, understand and memorize easily</li>
<li>Don&#39;t use the &quot;magical number seven&quot; to justify unnecessary design limitations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="origins-2">Origins</h3>
<p>Cognitive psychologist George Miller&#39;s 1956 paper titled &quot;The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information&quot;. The research was just indicating the best performing item count in a chuck was around that number, however the conclusion of the research under-interpreted as <em>The Magical Number Seven!,</em> which was a rhetorical choice of words from the beginning.</p>
<h4 id="psychology-concept-chunking">Psychology Concept: Chunking</h4>
<p>Miller found the size of the chunks (either letters or words) did not seem to matter, but the number of the items in chunks and the number of chunks did.</p>
<h3 id="examples-2">Examples</h3>
<p>Phone number input formatting: 4408675309 —&gt; (440) 867-5309</p>
<h4 id="key-consideration">Key Consideration</h4>
<p>Do not try to apply Miller&#39;s Law to components that don&#39;t need to be memorized by the user, such as navigation menus.</p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="postels-law">Postel&#39;s Law</h2>
<p><em>Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be flexible and tolerant for various actions user can take or inputs they might provide</li>
<li>Anticipate anything in terms of input, access and capability</li>
<li>Be clear while defining the boundaries of the input, and while giving the feedback for invalid ones</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="origins-3">Origins</h3>
<p>Also known as the robustness principle, based on the idea of a significant contributor of the TCP: John Postel. It&#39;s a guideline for the systems to follow while receiving and sending messages to the network they are in. The way web browsers parse and render HTML and CSS is also similar, they handle the syntax errors gracefully.</p>
<h3 id="examples-3">Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to UI, this law applies mostly to the form inputs. Auto formatting text inputs, search input with dictation capability.</li>
<li>Another good example is the application of biometrics in mobile devices.</li>
<li>Also the responsive design, the UI tries to adapt any screen resolution.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="key-consideration-design-resiliency">Key Consideration: Design Resiliency</h4>
<p>Postel&#39;s law comes with an opportunity to improve the accessibility, but it may also have some downsides like adjustable font sizes breaking the UI, translations in other languages breaks the positioning and etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="peak-end-rule">Peak-End Rule</h2>
<p><em>People judge an experience largely based on how they feld at its peak and at its end, rather than on the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pay close attention to the most intense points and the final moments of the user journey.</li>
<li>Identify the moments when your product is most helpful, valuable, or entertaining and design to delight to end user.</li>
<li>Remember that people recall negative experiences more vividly than positive ones.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="origins-4">Origins</h3>
<p>Various control groups found the less painful (even though they are more long) experiences more pleasant. Colonoscopy and water temperature experiments.</p>
<h4 id="psychology-concept-cognitive-biases">Psychology Concept: Cognitive Biases</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confirmation bias:</strong> impairs the confirmation of others</li>
<li><strong>Memory bias:</strong> impairs the recall of the memory</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples-4">Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mailchimp congratulating the user with high-fiving gorilla after the very first e-mail campaign has been sent.</li>
<li>Uber displaying the wait times with realistic explanation to the users.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technique-journey-mapping">Technique: Journey Mapping</h4>
<p>Can be used to map out the user journey and pinpoint the peak and end steps.</p>
<h4 id="key-consideration-negative-peaks">Key Consideration: Negative Peaks</h4>
<p>It is inevitable that something go wrong at some point in the lifespan of the journey. However, handling those errors gracefully and communicating them with the user in a sympathetic way (cute 404 messages) may decrease the negative impact.</p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-06.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="aesthetic-usability-effect">Aesthetic-Usability Effect</h2>
<p><em>Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as more usable.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An aesthetic design creates a positive response in people&#39;s brains and makes them think it&#39;s more usable</li>
<li>People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design of a product is aesthetically pleasing</li>
<li>Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems and prevent issues from being discovered during usability testing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="origins-5">Origins</h3>
<p>Goes back to the user testing sessions done for the ATM interfaces in Japan.</p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-11.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="psychology-concept-automatic-cognitive-processing">Psychology Concept: Automatic Cognitive Processing</h4>
<p>Contrary to what we have been taught not to do, people do in fact judge the books by their covers.</p>
<p>As discussed in the book <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman, our brain has two systems. The first one is used more effortlessly which carries over the intrinsic inheritance and gains. It makes quick scans for the objects, or the other stuff that we are interacting with, to decide they are worthy or not. This also applies to digital products, or services.</p>
<p>System 2 is used for more advanced tasks which require computation. It operates more slowly and requires mental effort to examine situations. Focus, research, memory retrievals and mathematical operations are some examples.</p>
<h3 id="examples-5">Examples</h3>
<p>Products that are both aesthetic and usable.</p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-12.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Braun SK4, designed by Hans Gugelot and Dieter Rams.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-13.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Apple&#39;s inspiration of the Braun products.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-07.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="von-restorff-effect">Von Restorff Effect</h2>
<p><em>When multiple similar objects are present, the other one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make important information or key actions visually distinctive.</li>
<li>Use restraint while placing emphasis on visual elements to avoid them competing with one another and to ensure salient items don&#39;t get mistakenly identified as ads.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t exclude those with a color deficiency or low vision by relying exclusively on color to communicate contrast.</li>
<li>Carefully consider users with motion sensitivity when using motion to communicate contrast.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="origins-6">Origins</h3>
<p>Dates back to the researches of German psychiatrist and pediatrician Hedwig von Restroff. It is a bit obvious: we best remember the distinctly different elements better.</p>
<h4 id="psychology-concept-selective-attention-banner-blindness-and-change-blindness">Psychology Concept: Selective Attention, Banner Blindness, and Change Blindness</h4>
<p>Attention is a limited resource, and we don&#39;t always realize the changes in front of us, unless they create a sense of attention.</p>
<p>Banner blindness: users think the content is an ad.</p>
<p>Change blindness: users don&#39;t realize the changes.</p>
<h3 id="examples-6">Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Confirmation modals with red action buttons (delete modal)</li>
<li>Material design FAB button for consistency for performing an action within any page</li>
<li>Pricing list with featured elements, with colors, size and etc.</li>
<li>App icon badges calling for attention</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="key-consideration-moderation-and-accessibility">Key Consideration: Moderation and Accessibility</h4>
<p>While designing for attention, we need to make sure the approaches taken won&#39;t create a noise in the interface, and they are accessible for people with disabilities.</p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-08.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="teslers-law">Tesler&#39;s Law</h2>
<p><em>For any system, there is a certain amount of complexity that cannot be reduced.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All processes have a core of complexity that cannot be designed away and therefore must be assumed by either the system or the user.</li>
<li>Ensure as much as possible of the burden is lifted from users by dealing with inherent complexity during design and development.</li>
<li>Take care not to simplify interfaces to the point of abstraction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="origins-7">Origins</h3>
<p>Dates back to the Xerox PARC days around mid-1980s. Lerry Tesler was a computer scientist working on the project, and his observed that the way users interact with a system is just as important as the system itself.</p>
<h3 id="examples-7">Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Technically, an e-mail needs three ingredients: sender, recipient, and the message. The e-mail clients are reducing the complexity by autofilling the sender address for us. Although we still need to deal with the remaining two, products like Gmail (Smart Compose) are leveraging AI to help the user by suggesting recipients, auto-completion for messages, and even pre-written replies.</li>
<li>Simplifying the checkout process with a checkbox to make the billing information as the same as shipping information.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Go:</strong> in store shopping without cash registries.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="key-consideration-when-simplicity-turns-to-abstraction">Key Consideration: When Simplicity Turns to Abstraction</h4>
<p>When an interface has been simplified to the point of abstraction, there is no longer enough information available for the users to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Again, ambiguous icons without text labels. We still don&#39;t have a standardized mapping for the icons and actions. Presenting them without labels may lead to an abstraction.</p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-09.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="doherty-threshold">Doherty Threshold</h2>
<p><em>Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (&lt;400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide system feedback within 400ms in order to keep users&#39; attention.</li>
<li>Use perceived performance to improve response time and reduce the perception of waiting.</li>
<li>Animation is one way to visually engage people while loading or processing is happening in the background.</li>
<li>Progress bards help make wait times tolerable, regardless of their accuracy.</li>
<li>Purposefully adding a delay to a process can actually increase its perceived value and instill a sense of trust, even when the process itself actually takes much less time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>100ms response feels instantaneous.</li>
<li>100 - 300ms begins to be perceivable.</li>
<li>If it extends 1000ms, people begin to think other things.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="origins-8">Origins</h3>
<p>IBM paper published in 1982 states the productivity increases in a direct correlation with the response time.</p>
<h4 id="examples-8">Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>Skeleton screens reduce the impression of waiting, and they are also useful for UI to be predictable.</li>
<li>Blur up technique for the images: Medium uses this to display a blurred version of the image till its fully loaded.</li>
<li>Progress indicators: it&#39;s a bit weird but their presence is more impactful than the accuracy.</li>
<li>Optimistic UI: Instagram example while posting a comment. The good thing here is it doesn&#39;t say &quot;POSTED!&quot; it immediately appends the written comment to the comment list but says &quot;Posting&quot; as the subtitle</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="key-consideration-when-response-times-are-too-fast">Key Consideration: When Response Times are Too Fast</h4>
<p>Fast response times can also cause several issues such as</p>
<ul>
<li>It is too fast to be perceivable, the feedback is missed.</li>
<li>It is too fast and the user thinks there was a problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Purposefully adding a delay to process can actually increase its perceived value and instill a sense of trust, even when the process actually takes much less time.</p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/laws-of-ux/laws-of-ux-14.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Facebook&#39;s Security Checkup process takes actually less time, but they prolong it to educate user.</p>
<h2 id="with-power-comes-responsibility">With Power Comes Responsibility</h2>
<p>Our responsibilities as designers, humane design, Skinner&#39;s Box...</p>
<p>The concepts we have seen in <a href="https://altay.wtf/books/hooked">Hooked</a> and <a href="https://altay.wtf/books/indistractable">Indistractable</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Intermittent variable rewards.</li>
<li>Infinite loops.</li>
<li>Social affirmation (like, retweet, share)</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocity</strong>: LinkedIn creating a sense of obligation to endorse back by sending a notification people endorses you.</li>
<li><strong>Dark patterns:</strong> only left X in stock.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-ethical-imperative">The Ethical Imperative</h4>
<p>Use more meaningful metrics like <em>helping people to achieve their goals</em> rather than &quot;daily active users&quot; or &quot;time spent on site&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="think-beyond-the-happy-path">Think Beyond the Happy Path</h4>
<p>Placing the edge cases in our thinking would help us to ensure that we&#39;re creating more resilient products that considers the most vulnerable cases by default.</p>
<h4 id="look-beyond-data">Look Beyond Data</h4>
<p>Quantitative data tells us lots of useful things but emotions. It&#39;s critical to gather other metrics by communicating with the users in order to understand them better, and serve them better.</p>
<h2 id="applying-psychological-principles-in-design">Applying Psychological Principles in Design</h2>
<p>Obviously, designers who learn and master psychological principles would produce more anticipating products and services for the humanity. This section goes through how to increase awareness over the concepts discussed in this book, and how to internalize them to use in our works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most effective way to leverage psychology in the design process is to embed it into everyday decision making.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="building-awareness">Building Awareness</h3>
<p><strong>By visibility:</strong> print-out the posters of each concept and put them into walls.</p>
<p><strong>Show and tell:</strong> knowledge sharing sessions on new techniques, tools and findings over the recent events such as usability tests or a recently completed project.</p>
<h3 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h3>
<p>Teams can create a consistent decision making within the design process by establishing a set of guidelines that represent the priorities and goals of a design team and serve as a foundation. Those principles would be used as the north star as the team produces more and more.</p>
<h4 id="defining-the-principles">Defining the Principles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Identify the team</li>
<li>Align and define</li>
<li>Diverge</li>
<li>Converge</li>
<li>Refine and apply</li>
<li>Circulate and advocate</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h4>
<ul>
<li>Good design principles are not truisms</li>
<li>Good design principles solve real questions</li>
<li>Good design principles are opinioated</li>
<li>Good design principles are memorable</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="connecting-principles-to-laws">Connecting Principles to Laws</h3>
<p>Define the principle, connect it with one or more laws, set rules to support them which should be used by all the members while designing interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Principle:</strong> <strong>Clarity over abundance of choice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> <em>According to Hick&#39;s Law, we know that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rules — To achieve this goal, we must:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limit choices to no more than 3 items at a time</li>
<li>Provide brief explanations when useful that are clear and no more than 80 characters</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Familiarity over novelty</strong></p>
<p><em>According to Jacob&#39;s Law, we know that the users spend most of their time on other sides, and they prefer our site to work the same away as all the other sites they already know.</em></p>
<p><strong>To achieve this goal, we must:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use common design patterns to reinforce familiarity with the interface</li>
<li>Avoid distracting the user with a flashy UI or quirky animations</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Quitters never win and winners never quit&quot; is a bad advice. Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time.</p>
<p>Most people quit, they just don&#39;t quit successfully. If you learn about the systems that encourages quitting, you most likely to be able to beat them.</p>
<h3 id="the-best-in-the-world-hannah-smith">The Best in the World: Hannah Smith</h3>
<p>Last year, 42K people graduated from the law schools in US but only 37 of them were awarded Supreme Court clerkships. The difference between is knowing then to quit, or accepting the mediocrity. Hannah Smith is one of those clerks, who is also a quitter. <strong>She quit countless of other pursuits in order to get here.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-surprising-value-of-being-the-best-in-the-world">The Surprising Value of Being the Best in the World</h3>
<p>The rewards are heavily skewed, #1 get ten times benefit of #10, and a hundred times benefit of #100.</p>
<p>Ice cream flavor popularity graph:</p>

<p>It&#39;s called <strong>the Zipf&#39;s law</strong>, and it applies to resumes and college application rates and best-selling records and everything in between. Winners win big because the marketplace loves a winner.</p>
<p>Scarcity also makes being at the top worth something.</p>
<h3 id="the-best-in-the-world">The Best in the World?</h3>
<p>Anyone who is going to hire you, buy from you, recommend you, vote for you, or do what you want them to do is going to wonder if they&#39;re the best choice.</p>
<p>Best as in: best for them, right now, based on what they believe and what they know</p>
<p><strong>The mass market is dying, there is no longer the best song, best coffee. Now there are a million of micro-markets, but each micro-market still has its best.</strong></p>

<h4 id="curve-2-the-cul-de-sac--dead-end"><strong>CURVE 2: THE CUL-DE-SAC — DEAD END</strong></h4>
<p>It is so simple and doesn&#39;t even need a chart. It&#39;s the situation where we work but nothing changes. It doesn&#39;t get a lot better, it doesn&#39;t get a lot worse. It just is. We need to get out of it fast, because the Cul-de-Sac has a big opportunity cost.</p>
<h4 id="curve-3-the-cliff"><strong>CURVE 3: THE CLIFF</strong></h4>
<p>The situation where you can&#39;t quit until you fall off, and the whole thing falls apart.</p>

<h3 id="seven-reasons-you-might-fail-to-become-the-best-in-the-world">Seven Reasons You Might Fail to Become the Best in the World</h3>
<ul>
<li>You run out of time, and quit</li>
<li>You run out of money, and quit</li>
<li>You get scared, and quit</li>
<li>You&#39;re not serious about it, and quit</li>
<li>You lose interest or enthusiasm or settle for being mediocre, and quit</li>
<li>You focus on the short term instead of the long, and quit when the short therm gets too hard</li>
<li>You pick the wrong thing at which to be the best in the world, because you don&#39;t have the talent</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eight-dip-curves">Eight Dip Curves</h3>
<h4 id="manufacturing-dip">Manufacturing Dip</h4>
<p>It&#39;s easy and fun to start building something in your garage, but hard to scale it for mass production.</p>
<h4 id="sales-dip">Sales Dip</h4>
<p>Starting with small, one seller (you) is fine, but the dip hits when you need to upgrade to a professional seller fource and scale it up.</p>
<h4 id="education-dip">Education Dip</h4>
<p>When it&#39;s time to learn something new, to reinvent and rebuild the skills. Like a doctor who sacrifices a year of her life for a specialty, and gets the reward for decades afterward.</p>
<h4 id="risk-dip">Risk Dip</h4>
<p>Taking risk to get through the dip vs crashing.</p>
<h4 id="relationship-dip">Relationship Dip</h4>
<p>You get into the dip but cannot pass through because lack of relationship building in the past.</p>
<h4 id="conceptual-dip">Conceptual Dip</h4>
<p>Re-inventing the situations by changing the assumptions that you&#39;ve gotten with so far.</p>
<h4 id="ego-dip">Ego Dip</h4>
<p>You can&#39;t pass through because you can&#39;t give up the control of the spotlight.</p>
<h4 id="distribution-dip">Distribution Dip</h4>
<p>Everyone can sell through the web, but getting into Walmart is hard.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-opportunity">The Big Opportunity</h3>
<p>If you can get through the Dip, if you can keep going when the system is expecting you to stop, you will achieve extraordinary results. People who make it through the Dip are scarce indeed, so they generate more value.</p>
<h3 id="average-is-for-losers">Average is for Losers</h3>
<p>The next time you catch yourself being average when you feel like quitting, realize that you have only two choices: be exceptional or be average.</p>

<p>Switching cash registry line example from the supermarket. You change your line, and there is another free. You switch to that one but then there is another...</p>
<p>The sad news is that when you start over, you get very little credit for how long you stood in line with your last great venture.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to be seduced by the new money and the rush to the fresh. The problem is that this leads to both an addiction and a very short attention span. If it doesn&#39;t work today, the thinking goes, why should I wait around until tomorrow? The problem is that only a tiny portion of the audience is looking for the brand-new thing. Most people are waiting for the tested, the authenticated, and the proven</p>
<h3 id="quitting-in-the-dip-is-usually-a-short-term-decisionand-a-bad-one">Quitting in the Dip Is Usually a Short-term Decision—and a Bad One</h3>
<p>Short-term pain has more impact on most people than long-term benefits do, which is why it&#39;s so important for us to amplify the long-term benefits of not quitting. Think about the gains you&#39;d get along the way. It&#39;s easier to stick out a lousy class if you can picture the graduation day.</p>
<h3 id="no-one-quit-the-boston-marathon-at-mile-25">No one Quit the Boston Marathon at Mile 25</h3>
<p>The drop out usually happens at the beginning, people has higher resistance through the end of the tunnel. We should be able to predict what would happen if we go till there though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it&#39;s a dead-end, every day you stay is a bad strategic decision for your career because every day you get better at something that isn&#39;t useful—and you are another day behind others who are learning something more useful. The only reason to stay is the short-term pain associated with quitting.</p>

<h3 id="quitting-as-an-intelligent-strategy">Quitting as an Intelligent Strategy</h3>
<p>Time to to look for a new job is when you don&#39;t need one. The time to switch jobs is before it feels comfortable. Go, switch, challenge yourself.</p>
<h3 id="never-quit">&quot;Never Quit&quot;</h3>
<p>&quot;Never quit&quot; is a bad advice, &quot;Never quit something with great long-term potential just because you can&#39;t deal with the stress of the moment&quot; is a good advice.</p>
<h3 id="three-questions-to-ask-before-quitting">Three Questions to Ask Before Quitting</h3>
<h4 id="am-i-panicking">AM I PANICKING?</h4>
<p>Quitting is not same as panicking, panic is never premeditated. Quitting when you&#39;re in panicked is dangerous and expensive, compared to having a proper plan what to do after you quit.</p>
<h4 id="who-am-i-trying-to-influence">WHO AM I TRYING TO INFLUENCE?</h4>
<p>If you are considering to quit, it&#39;s almost certainly because you&#39;re not being successful at your current attempt at influence. One person behaves different than the market, it would be harder to influence it since most of the times you need to convince first.</p>
<h4 id="what-sort-of-measurable-process-am-i-making">WHAT SORT OF MEASURABLE PROCESS AM I MAKING?</h4>
<p>Relationships, jobs or tasks have three states:</p>
<ul>
<li>moving forward</li>
<li>falling behind</li>
<li>standing still</li>
</ul>
<p>To succeed, we should be in the first one, even though it&#39;s small steps, but should contribute to the process so we&#39;d know it&#39;s not waste.</p>
<h3 id="quitting-before-you-start">Quitting Before You Start</h3>
<p>Write down under what circumstances you&#39;re willing to quit, and when.</p>
<p>And then, stick with it.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="chapter-1-a-pragmatic-philosophy">Chapter 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy</h2>
<p>In general, it gives bits of advice around professionalism and indicates that we, as programmers, can shape our paths.</p>
<h3 id="1-its-your-life">1. It&#39;s your life</h3>
<p>We have agency! The industry gives us opportunity to choose our work environment, field and technologies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can change your organization or change your organization.</p>
<p>&mdash; Martin Fowler</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-the-cat-ate-my-source-code">2. The Cat Ate My Source Code</h3>
<p>Take responsibility, be accountable, don&#39;t be afraid to admit your errors.</p>
<p>Teams should have an environment based on trust where the members can safely speak their mind, present ideas and rely on each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provide options, don&#39;t make lame excuses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before you tell why something can&#39;t be done, listen to yourself and ask if the excuse sounds reasonable. Try to predict the questions coming from the opposite side. Instead of excuses, provide options. Don&#39;t say it why it can&#39;t be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How do you react when someone comes to you with a lame excuse?</li>
<li>When you find yourself saying &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, be sure to follow up with &quot;—but I&#39;ll find out&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-software-entropy">3. Software Entropy</h3>
<p>Software projects will grow over time and they will obviously have tech debt. However, if we keep the tech debt at bare minimum during the growth phase, it&#39;ll be easier to work on the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t live with broken windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A single broken window was the reason of the decay of a whole city. Keep your codebase clean and pretty so the up-comers will pay extra attention to not contaminate it.</p>
<h3 id="4-stone-soup-and-boiled-frogs">4. Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs</h3>
<p><strong>Stone soup:</strong> the story of hungry soldiers who trick villagers to take out their hoardings by telling them they are cooking a stone soup but it becomes more tasty if we add potato, beef, salad, etc...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be a catalyst for the change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story tries to indicate that if you know what needs to be done but not able to convince people with words, try to build something and give a taste of it.</p>
<p><strong>Boiled frogs:</strong> if you throw frogs to a boiling water they&#39;ll immediately run away but if you put them into cold water and boil them, they won&#39;t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember the big picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="5-good-enough-software">5. Good-enough software</h3>
<p>A software is good enough when it satisfies the expectations of its users. Thus, we should involve users during the decision making process and try to keep efficiency in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great software today is often preferable to the perfect software tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="6-your-knowledge-portfolio">6. Your Knowledge Portfolio</h3>
<p>Our knowledge is one of the expiring assets. It becomes out of date as new techniques, languages or technologies aspire. We should focus on forming habits to keep ourselves up to date.</p>
<p><strong>Building the portfolio</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest regularly:</strong> set sample goals, doesn&#39;t matter how big they are!</li>
<li><strong>Diversify:</strong> try to become comfortable with different kind of technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Manage risk:</strong> don&#39;t go all-in in new tech.</li>
<li><strong>Buy low, sell high:</strong> a bit contra-dictionary to the previous item but remember what happened with React and React Native.</li>
<li><strong>Review and rebalance</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn at least one language per year</li>
<li>Read a technical book each month</li>
<li>Read non-technical books too</li>
<li>Take classes</li>
<li>Participate in local user groups and meetups</li>
<li>Experiment with different environments</li>
<li>Stay current</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critical Thinking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the &quot;Five Whys&quot;</li>
<li>Who does this benefit?</li>
<li>What&#39;s the context?</li>
<li>When or where would this work?</li>
<li>Why is this a problem?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-communicate">7. Communicate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Know what you want to say</li>
<li>Know your audience</li>
<li>Chose your moment</li>
<li>Choose a style</li>
<li>Make it look good</li>
<li>Involve your audience</li>
<li>Be a listener</li>
<li>Get back to people</li>
<li>Keep code and documentation together</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-2-a-pragmatic-approach">Chapter 2: A Pragmatic Approach</h2>
<p>Fundamental tips and tricks to follow while approaching problems in the software projects. They are generic concepts that could be applied to any kind of project or company.</p>
<h3 id="8-the-essence-of-good-design">8. The Essence of Good Design</h3>
<p>Encourage and follow <strong>Easier To Change, ETC</strong> principle. The wizardry to determine what is easier to change would be achieved in time, but keep your lights on to develop instincts.</p>
<h3 id="9-dry--the-evils-of-duplication">9. DRY — The Evils of Duplication</h3>
<p>It&#39;s one of the buzzwords going around. The take-away from the book is: DRY Is more than code!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DRY is about the duplication of knowledge, of intent. It&#39;s about expressing the same thing in two different places, possibly in two different ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="10-orthogonality">10. Orthogonality</h3>
<p>Two systems are orthogonal if they are designed to be decoupled. When we design the components isolated from each other, we gain productivity and reduce risk.</p>
<h3 id="11-reversibility">11. Reversibility</h3>
<p>As like everything in this world, the requirements for our software projects might become hard to predict and require lots of changed along the way. To decrease the workload during those inevitable changes, we may <em>hide third-party APIs behind our own abstraction layers</em> and <em>break our code to components,</em> regardless of the architecture and pipeline.</p>
<h3 id="12-tracer-bullets">12. Tracer Bullets</h3>
<p>We are trying to shoot in the dark and tracer bullets are a way to see our surroundings to become more prepared. In this context,. a-tracer-bullet software would be the simplified version of the almost-production-ready system, which is presentable to the stakeholders and usable during the implementation. They are similar to MVP in some sense.</p>
<h3 id="13-prototypes-and-post-it-notes">13. Prototypes and Post-it Notes</h3>
<p>They are similar to tracer bullets but without the requirement of being able to work, or production ready quality. Prototypes can even be made of post-it notes or some whiteboard sketches while trying to foresee how the project could be shaped up considering the requirements. While building a prototype, we can ignore <em>correctness, completeness, robustness,</em> and the <em>style</em>. One challenge here is to make sure everyone involved understands the distinction between a prototype and a tracer bullet.</p>
<h3 id="14-domain-languages">14. Domain Languages</h3>
<p><strong>Internal domain languages:</strong> RSpec, Phoenix router example</p>
<p><strong>External domain languages:</strong> Cucumber (parsed), Ansible (uses YAML)</p>
<h3 id="15-estimating">15. Estimating</h3>
<p>Similar to the ETC, estimating is also a skill that develops over time. To become a successful estimator, there are several points we can keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand what&#39;s being asked:</strong> clarify the requirements, discover the side-effects</li>
<li><strong>Build a mental model of the system:</strong> find out the inaccuracies and drawbacks</li>
<li><strong>Break the model into components:</strong> define the interaction between them and assign parameters</li>
<li><strong>Give each parameter a value:</strong> a multiplying factor to be used for each component</li>
<li><strong>Calculate the answers:</strong> don&#39;t be surprised if your calculations are weird, they may indicate a missing point or a misunderstood model</li>
<li><strong>Keep track of your estimating prowess:</strong> the only way to get better, ha?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-3-the-basic-tools">Chapter 3: The Basic Tools</h2>
<p>From the importance of using plain text to becoming more comfortable while using shell, keyboard shortcuts, and tips and tricks to debug our bugs.</p>
<h3 id="16-the-power-of-plain-text">16. The Power of Plain Text</h3>
<p>HTML, JSON, YAML, XML are considered as plain text since they are parseable with a partial knowledge of the format. The actual problem is the text generated by a program is only readable with a similar kind of that program. Backed up by the experience, the text always outlives the software that produced it.</p>
<h3 id="17-shell-games">17. Shell Games</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A benefit of GUIs is WYSIWYG — what you see is what you get. The disadvantage is WYSIAYG — what you see is all you get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explore the capabilities of your shell, customize it, use aliases and command completion.</p>
<h3 id="18-power-editing">18. Power Editing</h3>
<p>We need to be able to manipulate the text as effortlessly as possible. To do so, we should achieve editor fluency. Avoid repetitive tasks and usage of trackpad/mouse and try to think in &quot;there must be a better way&quot; mindset.</p>
<h3 id="19-version-control">19. Version Control</h3>
<p>No matter the size or the scope of the project, team... always use it.</p>
<h3 id="20-debugging">20. Debugging</h3>
<p>The origins of &quot;bug&quot; in software word is coming from an actual bug (moth) caught in the computer system back in the days of COBOL. They captured it and dutifully taped to the log book.</p>
<h4 id="psychology-of-debugging"><strong>Psychology of Debugging</strong></h4>
<p>The main purpose should be fixing the problem, not the blame.</p>
<h4 id="a-debugging-mindset"><strong>A Debugging Mindset</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Turn off your defenses, detach your ego</li>
<li>Don&#39;t panic</li>
<li>Don&#39;t waste time by saying &quot;<em>but, that&#39;s impossible</em>&quot;, it obviously is</li>
<li>Beware of myopia when debugging, always try to discover the root cause</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="where-to-start"><strong>Where to Start</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the project is building without any warnings</li>
<li>Gather all the relevant data, steps to reproduce, user scenarios</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="debugging-strategies"><strong>Debugging Strategies</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Failing tests that reproduces bugs:</strong> if it takes 15 steps to reproduce a bug, write a failing test for it.</li>
<li><strong>Regression across releases:</strong> compare the diff or switch back and forth to inspect the changes.</li>
<li><strong>Process of elimination:</strong> assume the application code is broken before searching for the cause in OS, the compiler or a thrid-party product.</li>
<li><strong>Binary chop:</strong> use divide and conquer approach for stack traces or logs to narrow down the scope.</li>
<li><strong>Logging and tracing:</strong> Sentry, Crashlytics, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Rubber ducking:</strong> explain what the code supposed to do and the problems to another person (or a rubber duck in your desk)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-element-of-surprise"><strong>The Element of Surprise</strong></h4>
<p>When we find ourselves surprised by a bug, we must reevaluate the truths we hold dear. If the bug occurred in this piece of code, another piece which relies on the same concepts may also have a problem.</p>
<h3 id="21-text-manipulation">21. Text Manipulation</h3>
<p>Learn a text manipulation language (or tool) to make fancy stuff like auto-generating table of contents of this book.</p>
<h3 id="22-engineering-daybooks">22. Engineering Daybooks</h3>
<p>Handwritten notebooks to keep track of what I am working on, take notes on meetings, the things I learnt today and the ideas come up to my mind while dealing with the tasks. Pen and paper helps in a sense since it makes it easier to sketch and scribble.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-pragmatic-paranoia">Chapter 4: Pragmatic Paranoia</h2>
<p>Most of the humans perceive world as me vs. the rest, so do we. Programmers also look other&#39;s code in a similar way. But, why stop there? We should take it one step further and don&#39;t trust our code either. No one writes perfect code, there&#39;s no perfect software, everybody is going to die, come watch TV!</p>
<h3 id="23-design-by-contract">23. Design by Contract</h3>
<p>Similar to real world agreements between people, the interactions between software modules can also be secured by contracts. The DBC term first proposed by Bertrand Meyer as a part of the Eiffel programming language. Programs should document and verify their claims and it that would lead to predictability in case the contract is violated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preconditions:</strong> what must be true in order for routine to be called, an active bank account with positive balance for an outgoing transaction for example.</li>
<li><strong>Postconditions:</strong> what the routine is guaranteed to do, the state of the world when it is executed. The outgoing transaction is created an it&#39;s included in the list of transactions for the bank account.</li>
<li><strong>Class invariants — state:</strong> should be updated to represent the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>DBC is not a concept we can drop in favor of TDD or defensive programming. It&#39;s a complementary approach to increase the confidence.</p>
<h3 id="24-dead-programs-tell-no-lies">24. Dead Programs Tell No Lies</h3>
<p>Again, leave the &quot;it can&#39;t happen&quot; mentality behind and treat errors as a first class citizen in your mind. They usually indicate something very, very bad has happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out Erlang&#39;s <em>supervisor trees</em> approach to capture errors in a propagated places instead of having verbose exception mapping blocks within the subroutines.</p>
<h3 id="25-assertive-programming">25. Assertive Programming</h3>
<p>This doesn&#39;t apply to the languages I&#39;ve dealt with but using assertions for exceptions (Java) is actually helpful since they throw traceable exceptions with a recognizable type and message. The book also suggests to keep assertions in code no matter if they&#39;re covered with tests since they could be helpful to detect unforeseeable exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="26-how-to-balance-resources">26. How to Balance Resources</h3>
<p>Refers to the allocating and deallocating any kind of resources (memory, transactions, threads, network connections, file, timers, etc) that we are consuming in our programs.</p>
<p>The main responsibility to keep in mind is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finish what you start.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="nest-allocations"><strong>Nest allocations</strong></h4>
<p>Deallocate resources in the opposite orders you allocate them so there won&#39;t be any orphans in case of a dependent resource situation.</p>
<h4 id="always-allocate-in-the-same-order"><strong>Always allocate in the same order</strong></h4>
<p>If process A wants R1 then R2, process B wants R2 then R1, that may cause a deadlock.</p>
<h4 id="whoever-allocates-a-resource-should-be-responsible-for-deallocating-it"><strong>Whoever allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it</strong></h4>
<p>There was a ruby code example in the book about this. Refer to page 119-120 or put them here.</p>
<h4 id="balancing-and-exceptions"><strong>Balancing and exceptions</strong></h4>
<p>Languages with exceptions, or the way handle them can make resource allocation tricky.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let resource

try {
  resource = allocateResource()
  process(resource)
} finally {
  deallocateResource(resource)
}
</code></pre>
<p>If resource allocation fails and exception is thrown, <code>finally</code> cause will try to deallocate a thing that was never allocated.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const resource = allocateResource()

try {
  process(resource)
} finally {
  deallocateResource(resource)
}
</code></pre>
<p>We are safer with this approach and the exception of resource allocation will be propagated to the upper scope.</p>
<h4 id="use-wrappers-for-resources">Use w<strong>rappers for resources</strong></h4>
<p>We can also write wrappers for resources for allocation, deallocation and check if they are healthy.</p>
<h3 id="27-dont-outrun-your-headlights">27. Don&#39;t Outrun Your Headlights</h3>
<p>The phrase <em>outrunning the headlights</em> comes from taking turns or going fast with a vehicle the projector of headlines are not able to illuminate the path since it&#39;s made for a straight line. The main idea is to take small steps and adjust your next moves based on the feedbacks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider that the rate of the feedback is your speed limit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="chapter-5-bend-or-break">Chapter 5: Bend, or Break</h2>
<p>Practical approaches for every-day problems that we come across as programmers. Talks about concepts like decoupling, state machines, event handling, thinking programs as data transformers and using configuration.</p>
<h3 id="28-decoupling">28. Decoupling</h3>
<p>Linking components in a system together is good if you are trying to build a bridge but it is not the best approach while writing software, which we prefer to be flexible since the quality of a software can be measurable by it&#39;s easiness to change over time.</p>
<p>Symptoms of coupling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wacky dependencies between unrelated modules</li>
<li>&quot;Simple&quot; changes in a module requires thousand other changes in unrelated modules</li>
<li>Developers who are afraid to touch code because they don&#39;t know what might be affected</li>
<li>Meetings where everyone has to attend because no one is sure who will be affected by a change</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="train-wrecks"><strong>Train Wrecks</strong></h4>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function applyDiscount(customer, order_id, discount) {
  const totals = customer.orders.find(order_id).getTotals()

  totals.grandTotal = totals.grandTotal - discount
  totals.discount = discount
}
</code></pre>
<p>Problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top level code needs to know all the chained methods exist and what do they return.</li>
<li>It&#39;d be better if totals object manages the discount but it&#39;s just a container everyone can access and modify. Imagine if we introduce a constraint for maximum discount amount being 40%, it&#39;s nearly impossible to manage that.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Tell, don&#39;t ask principle</em></strong> states that we shouldn&#39;t make decisions based on the internal state of the object and then update the object. It should be capable of doing that itself without breaking the encapsulation and exposing the knowledge all over the system.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function applyDiscount(customer, order_id, discount) {
  customer
    // TDA: we don&#39;t care if orders are list or map, we just want to find it
    // orders
    // .find(order_id)
    .findOrder(order_id)

    // TDA: pls apply the discount, I don&#39;t care who manages it
    // .getTotals()
    // .applyDiscount(discount)
    .applyDiscount(discount)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming that <em>customers</em> and <em>orders</em> are one of the top-level concepts of this application, this might be enough.</p>
<h4 id="law-of-demeter"><strong>Law of Demeter</strong></h4>
<p>Ian Holland&#39;s guidelines to decrease the train wreck. A method defined in C class should only call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other instance methods in C</li>
<li>Its parameters</li>
<li>Methods in objects that it creates</li>
<li>Global variables</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-evils-of-globalization"><strong>The Evils of Globalization</strong></h4>
<p>Try to avoid the usage of global data. It makes the code coupled and also you&#39;ll realize the setup function on your tests is also a mess. Creating a singleton with fancy methods wouldn&#39;t make it OK.</p>
<h3 id="29-juggling-the-real-world">29. Juggling the Real World</h3>
<h4 id="finite-state-machines"><strong>Finite state machines</strong></h4>
<p>Underrated and very useful way to represent your systems reaction based on the events it receive. The example on page 140 was great.</p>
<h4 id="the-observer-pattern"><strong>The observer pattern</strong></h4>
<p>Simple way to implement event listeners from a source. One downside is the event source is aware of its listeners so they are theoretically coupled, which is not a big problem if they are in the same context.</p>
<h4 id="publish--subscribe"><strong>Publish / subscribe</strong></h4>
<p>More generalized observer pattern which makes the source unaware of its listeners. Events are published to a channel that subscribers are listening. The downside is it can be hard to see what is going on in a system that uses pub-sub heavily.</p>
<h4 id="reactive-programming-and-streams"><strong>Reactive programming and streams</strong></h4>
<p>Useful for combining multiple sources and creating new streams from the events. We can also generate parallel streams from an event source, then re-combine them into one and etc.</p>
<h3 id="30-transforming-programming">30. Transforming Programming</h3>
<p>Think of a program as a transformer that takes an input and generates and output. Based on the requirements, we can streamline the steps to transform the input and isolate them from each other in order to be re-usable, which leads to this tip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t hoard the state; pass it around!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pipeline operator and kinda railway-oriented approach is shown here with several examples with Elixir. We can choose to handle errors within the transformation itself (return tuple and use overloading) or handle it in the pipeline (bind operator with monadic return values).</p>
<p><strong>Language X Doesn&#39;t Have Pipelines</strong></p>
<p>Thinking in transformations doesn&#39;t really require it. We can also streamline our steps as intermediate variables to get the job done.</p>
<h3 id="31-inheritance-tax">31. Inheritance Tax</h3>
<h4 id="using-inheritance-to-share-code">Using Inheritance t<strong>o Share Code</strong></h4>
<p>We can use inheritance to add common functionality from a base class to into child classes; <code>User</code> and <code>Product</code> are both subclasses of <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>.</p>
<p>This is problematic since both the code that uses the child and child itself are coupled to its parent, its parent&#39;s parent and so on. It introduces coupling to the codebase.</p>
<h4 id="using-inheritance-to-build-types">Using Inheritance t<strong>o Build Types</strong></h4>
<p>We can use inheritance to express the relationship between classes; a <code>Car</code> and a <code>Bicycle</code> are-a-kind-of <code>Vehicle</code>.</p>
<p>This would be problematic once we start introducing more types that can be inherited by <code>Car</code> and <code>Bicycle</code> objects since they can also be <code>Asset</code>, <code>InsuredItem</code>, and so on. It leads to multiple inheritance.</p>
<h4 id="avoiding-inheritance-with-interfaces-and-protocols">Avoiding Inheritance with <strong>Interfaces and Protocols</strong></h4>
<p>Instead of creating the base class, we can use interfaces or protocols to specify that a class implements one or more set of behaviors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interfaces and protocols give us inheritance without polymorphism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <code>Car</code> can implement <code>Drivable</code>, <code>Locatable</code> and <code>Insurable</code> behaviors where a <code>Bicycle</code> is only <code>Drivable</code> and <code>Insurable</code>. We can use a <code>List&lt;Drivable&gt;</code> to store instances of both classes.</p>
<h4 id="avoiding-inheritance-with-delegation">Avoiding Inheritance with Delegation</h4>
<p>Using inheritance usually overloads the classes with methods which we wouldn&#39;t probably expose (gorilla-banana-jungle problem). We can use delegation as an alternative to inheritance in order to perform respective tasks we&#39;d inherit.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">#### instead of
class Account &lt; PersistanceBaseClass
end

<p>Now the <code>AccountRecord</code> is really decoupled but it would make us to write more boilerplate code for common methods such as <code>find</code>, but we can use mixins and traits for that.</p>
<h4 id="avoiding-inheritance-with-mixins-traits-categories-protocol-extensions-">Avoiding Inheritance with Mixins, Traits, Categories, Protocol Extensions, ...</h4>
<p>Although the naming varies to language, the idea between mixins is to create a set of functions that can be used to extend a class to use them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">mixin CommonFinders
    def find(id) { ... }
    def findAll() { ... }
end

class AccountRecord extends BasicRecord with CommonFinders
class UserRecord extends BasicRecord with CommonFinders

<h3 id="32-configuration">32. Configuration</h3>
<p>In addition to the static configuration that we are mostly familiar with (JSON, YAML, etc), the book also suggest to consider using <strong>Configuration-As-A-Service approach</strong> in order to make it shareable across multiple applications, editable via a GUI tool and dynamic. This dynamism would help us to register the respective parts of our application to the configuration updates and react to the changes without having to restart the whole application.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6-concurrency">Chapter 6: Concurrency</h2>
<h4 id="concurrency-parallelism-and-temporal-coupling">Concurrency, parallelism and temporal coupling</h4>
<p><em>Concurrency</em> is when the execution of two or more pieces of code act as if they run at the same time.</p>
<p><em>Parallelism</em> is when they <em>do</em> run at the same time.</p>
<p><em>Temporal coupling</em> happens when our code imposes a sequence on things that is not required to solve the problem at hand.</p>
<h3 id="33-breaking-temporal-coupling">33. Breaking Temporal Coupling</h3>
<p>Temporal coupling is about time, which is usually ignored while designing the architecture in the linear mindset. We need to allow for concurrency and think about decoupling in the workflows, and we can use activity diagrams to detect concurrencies and maximize parallelism in the architecture.</p>
<h4 id="using-activity-diagrams">Using Activity Diagrams</h4>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/the-pragmatic-programmer/the-pragmatic-programmer-01.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/the-pragmatic-programmer/the-pragmatic-programmer-02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Identify the opportunities for concurrency and parallelism, then get back to your application. Keep in mind that the activity diagram would only show the opportunities, and exploiting them is up to you. For example, a bartender would need five hands to be able to run the all tasks at once.</p>
<h3 id="34-shared-state-is-incorrect-state">34. Shared State is Incorrect State</h3>
<p>The customer-waiter-pie example starts here. You are in a restaurant (customer A) and asked if they have an apple pie, the waiter (X) looks at the display case and says yes. However, another customer (B) and waiter (Y) has the same conversation in the meantime. Who gets the pie?</p>
<h4 id="nonatomic-updates">Nonatomic updates</h4>
<p><img src="https://altay.wtf/images/books/the-pragmatic-programmer/the-pragmatic-programmer-03.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> to processes can access and write to the same memory at the same time. Since fetching and updating the pie count is not an atomic operation, the underlying value can change in the middle. So, we can&#39;t guarantee who gets the pie.</p>
<h4 id="atomic-updates-semaphores-and-other-forms-of-mutual-exclusion">Atomic updates: semaphores and other forms of mutual exclusion</h4>
<p>A semaphore is simply a thing that only one person can own at a time. For the physical pie problem, we can place a plastic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprechaun">Leprechaun</a> and introduce the constraint of holding the Leprechaun in one hand to be able to get the pie. Software representation of this is simply a lock.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">#### waiter&#39;s logic
case_semaphore.lock()

if display_case.pie_count() &gt; 0
    promise_pie_to_customer()
    display_case.take_pie()
    give_pie_to_customer()
end

case_semaphore.unlock()
</code></pre>
<p>The problem here is to align everyone on the constraint of using the semaphore, which is on the code level and not really enforcing any constraints.</p>
<h4 id="atomic-updates-make-the-resource-transactional">Atomic updates: make the resource transactional</h4>
<p>The lock flow above is not sufficient enough since it delegates the responsibility of protection to the consumer of the resource. We can centralize that check and take the control into the provider&#39;s hands by making the resource transactional.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">#### API exposed by the provider
def get_pie_if_available()
    @case_semaphore.lock()

    try {
        if @slices.size &gt; 0
            update_sales_data(:pie)
            return @slices.shift
        else
            false
        end
    }
    #### update_sales_data may throw, then we&#39;d have a deadlock
    ensure {
        @case_semaphore.unlock()
    }
end

#### waiter&#39;s logic
slice = get_pie_if_available()

if slice
    #### serve the slice of pie
else
    #### say sorrrrry
end
</code></pre>
<h4 id="atomic-updates-multiple-resource-transactions">Atomic updates: multiple resource transactions</h4>
<p>We might say that we have a solution for the pie problem. Now it&#39;s the summer season and we add an option to our menu to serve the pie with ice cream. They can still be ordered separately, but the customers prefer to get the combined option. How can we make sure we serve them correctly?</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">#### waiter&#39;s logic
slice = display_case.get_pie_if_available()
scoop = freezer.get_ice_cream_if_available()

if slice &amp;&amp; scoop
    give_order_to_customer()
end
</code></pre>
<p>This wouldn&#39;t work because it doesn&#39;t ensure the availability of both resources before accessing either of them. We can get the pie but it would be meaningless without the ice cream, and logic to put it back would be another overhaul.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">#### waiter&#39;s logic
slice = display_case.get_pie_if_available()

if slice {
    try {
      scoop = freezer.get_ice_cream_if_available()

        if scoop
        try {
            give_order_to_customer()
        }
        rescue {
            freezer.give_back(scoop)
        }
        end
    }
    rescue {
        display_case.give_back(slice)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A more elegant way to solve this to create another resource called <code>slice_with_ice_cream</code> and move the resource handling to resource itself, as we did for the <code>slice</code> and <code>scoop</code>.</p>
<h4 id="more-takeaways">More takeaways</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Random failures are often concurrency issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concurrency problems do not only occur for shared memories, they can also be seen while using any kind of shared resources: files, databases, external services, etc.</p>
<p>Mutual exclusion (mutex) term is used for some kind of exclusive access to shared resources, most languages have libraries to support this.</p>
<h3 id="35-actors-and-processes">35. Actors and Processes</h3>
<p>Actors and processes offers interesting ways implementing concurrency without the burden of synchronizing the state.</p>
<p><strong>An actor is an independent virtual processor that has its own state which is not accessible outside of its context.</strong> It waits on the idle state and processes the messages reaching to its mailbox. After the completion, it can consume the queued messages or go back to idle state.</p>
<p><strong>A process is typically a more general-purpose virtual processor, often implemented by the operating system to facilitate concurrency.</strong> They are constrained to behave like actors.</p>
<p>Some facts about them:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&#39;s no orchestration logic that schedules what happens next.</li>
<li>The only state in the system is held in the messages and in the local state of each individual actor.</li>
<li>All messages are one way.</li>
<li>An actor processes each message to completion, and only processes one message at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an example of actor system implementation in the book, built with <a href="https://nact.io">nact</a>.</p>
<h3 id="36-blackboards">36. Blackboards</h3>
<p>Blackboard stores some facts about the system, many independent actors can be spawned by the changes on that system, work on their processes then add more to the system.</p>
<p>The book describes the blackboard as a real blackboard that we write the details about a criminal case, and detectives as actors who are trying to solve that case.</p>
<p>Blackboard can be used for collective knowledge gathering systems, such as natural language processing, mortgage application lookup and finding an appropriate time for a set of friends to meet in their favorite pizza spot.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7-while-you-are-coding">Chapter 7: While You Are Coding</h2>
<p>Things to keep in mind while we are on it... Instincts, awareness, performance, refactoring and more!</p>
<h3 id="37-listen-to-your-lizard-brain">37. Listen to Your Lizard Brain</h3>
<p>Lizard Brain → our instincts. Feeling in danger on physical situations is not something made up by our mind, it is actually a response generated by our non-conscious brain. Our lizard brain actually develops over time, by experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>We encounter with the objections from the lizard brain while doing stuff, especially if the page is plain white. First thing to do is to acknowledge that, then take a step back and give time to your brain to organize itself. Do not try to fight or beat it, instead take advantage of that objection to re-think your design, explain it to some other people, and try prototyping instead of solving the problem all together. After you reach a stage that feels like you are in <em>the flow</em>, get rid of that prototype and start over.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t have to be your code, or just code.</p>
<h3 id="38-programming-by-coincidence">38. Programming by Coincidence</h3>
<p><em>My code doesn&#39;t work, no idea why. My code works, no idea why.</em></p>
<h4 id="how-to-program-deliberately"><strong>How to Program Deliberately</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Always be aware of what you are doing.</li>
<li>Can you explain code to a junior programmer?</li>
<li>Proceed from a plan.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t depend on assumptions, rely on reliable things.</li>
<li>Document your assumptions.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t just test your code, test your assumptions as well.</li>
<li>Prioritize the effort to spend time on the important aspects, like the blueprint.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t let existing code dictate future code. All code can be replaced if it is no longer appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="39-algorithm-speed">39. Algorithm Speed</h3>
<p>Big-O notation, common sense for some algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple loops: <code>O(n)</code></li>
<li>Nested loops: <code>O(n*n)</code></li>
<li>Binary chop: <code>O(logn)</code></li>
<li>Divide and conquer: <code>O(nlogn)</code></li>
<li>Combinatoric: <code>O(c^n)</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="40-refactoring">40. Refactoring</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Refactor early, refactor often</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Residential building metaphor: architect draws up blueprints, contracts dig the foundation and build the structure, tenants move in live happily after, then they call the building maintenance to fix any problems, or hire some other contractors to improve the conditions.</p>
<p>Refactoring should not change the external behavior of the code, so it is not about adding features. It should aim to make it code easier to change.</p>
<h4 id="when-should-we-refactor">When should we refactor?</h4>
<p>When we learned something new, understand something better than we did last year, yesterday, or even just a few minutes ago. There are many other things that can be considered as refactoring opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplication</li>
<li>Non-orthogonal design</li>
<li>Outdated knowledge</li>
<li>Usage</li>
<li>Performance</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-do-we-refactor">How do we refactor?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t try to refactor and add functionality at the same time</li>
<li>Make sure we have good tests before refactoring, run them as often as possible</li>
<li>Take short, deliberate steps</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="41-test-to-code">41. Test to Code</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Testing is not about finding bugs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your tests will be the first user of your code, and this process would make you think not only as the author. It will also improve the styling while as you will be aiming both for testability and functionality.</p>
<h4 id="tdd-cycle">TDD cycle</h4>
<ul>
<li>Decide on a small piece of functionality we want to add.</li>
<li>Write a test that will pass once it&#39;s implemented.</li>
<li>Run all tests, verify the only one fails is the one we just wrote.</li>
<li>Write time smallest amount of code needed to get this test pass, and verify the tests now run cleanly.</li>
<li>Refactor the code.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t exaggerate the TDD cycle, testing the classnames, references and other trivial things do not add value.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-culture-of-testing">A Culture of Testing</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test first:</strong> TDD</li>
<li><strong>Test during:</strong> test while you code</li>
<li><strong>Test never:</strong> gg</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Test your software, or your users will</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="42-property-based-testing">42. Property-Based Testing</h3>
<p>A complementary approach to unit-testing. Uses randomly generated data as inputs to our modules in order to observe how would they behave in edge cases, high load, weird inputs.</p>
<p>The failures we come across during property-based tests are often surprises us, and they might indicate bad assumptions.</p>
<h3 id="43-stay-safe-out-there">43. Stay Safe Out There</h3>
<p>Basic principles of security:</p>
<h4 id="minimize-attack-surface-area">Minimize Attack Surface Area</h4>
<p>The sum of all access points that a system can be compromised.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code complexity:</strong> less code is more secure</li>
<li><strong>Input data:</strong> always validate input data before running queries and etc</li>
<li><strong>Unauthenticated services</strong></li>
<li><strong>Authenticated services:</strong> keep the number of authorized users at an absolute minimum. Cull unused, old, or outdated users or services.</li>
<li><strong>Output data:</strong> don&#39;t giveaway or try to obfuscate potentially risky information</li>
<li><strong>Debugging info:</strong> don&#39;t print the whole stack-trace on production</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="principle-of-least-privilege">Principle of Least Privilege</h4>
<p>Don&#39;t automatically grab the highest permission level such as <em>root</em> or <em>Administrator.</em> Try to accomplish tasks with the minimum privilege.</p>
<h4 id="secure-defaults">Secure Defaults</h4>
<p>The default settings, interface, configuration on your app should be in the most secure way.</p>
<h4 id="encrypt-sensitive-data">Encrypt Sensitive Data</h4>
<p>Don&#39;t leave personally identifiable information, financial data, passwords or other credentials in plain text, whether in a DB or some other external file. Don&#39;t check in them to version control, manage keys and secrets decoupled from the system as a part of build end deployment.</p>
<h4 id="maintain-security-updates">Maintain Security Updates</h4>
<p>Just remember the largest data breaches in history were caused by systems that were behind on their updates.</p>
<h4 id="common-sense-vs-crypto">Common Sense vs. Crypto</h4>
<p>The first and foremost rule when it comes to crypto is <em>never do it yourself</em>. It doesn&#39;t only apply to cyphering sensitive information, you should also prefer reliable 3rd party providers for the authentication part.</p>
<h3 id="44-naming-things">44. Naming Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>Honor the culture of the language, framework, etc.</li>
<li>Keep it consistent with the rest of the project.</li>
<li>Name well, rename when needed. If you can&#39;t change the now-wrong name easily, it indicates we got a bigger problem, an <em>Easy-to-Change</em> violation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-8-before-the-project">Chapter 8: Before the Project</h2>
<h3 id="45-the-requirements-pit">45. The Requirements Pit</h3>
<p>Requirements are not really clear on every project, they rarely lie on the surface. They are buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics. Even worse, they don&#39;t exist at all.</p>
<p>As programmers, it&#39;s one of our qualifications to look for the edge cases, think about the illogical scenarios and help the client to reflect the requirements better. That&#39;s what makes our job intellectual and creative. We need to have knowledge about the business itself (sometimes it helps to spend some time in the actual field) and ability to thing about the logical representation when it&#39;s reflected by ones and zeroes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work with a user to think like a user</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="requirements-vs-policy">Requirements vs. Policy</h4>
<p>Some requirements (like privileges) are actually policies which should be implemented as metadata.</p>
<h4 id="requirements-vs-reality">Requirements vs. Reality</h4>
<p>Short feedback loops plays an extremely important rule on this topic. Brian Eno thought he designed the perfect recording engineer keyboard but all the controls are tied to keyboard and mouse unlike the analog fine-tuning options provided by the classical methods.</p>
<h4 id="documenting-requirements">Documenting Requirements</h4>
<p>This might be a bit waste of time since the clients usually don&#39;t read them because they are more into the high-level solution of the problem. However, it&#39;d might be helpful for the developers.</p>
<p>Prefer user stories instead of requirements to visualize the progress better, and more perceivable for stakeholders with different technical backgrounds.</p>
<p>Good requirements are abstract, requirements are not architecture, they are the need. Don&#39;t oversimplify, nor over exaggerate.</p>
<h4 id="maintain-a-glossary">Maintain a Glossary</h4>
<p>One place that defines all the specific terms and vocabulary used in a project.</p>
<h3 id="46-solving-impossible-puzzles">46. Solving Impossible Puzzles</h3>
<p>In order to think &quot;outside of the box&quot;, you need to &quot;find the box&quot; first. The secret to solving impossible puzzles is to identify the real constraints.</p>
<p>When faced with an intractable problem, enumerate all the possible avenues before you, no matter how unusable or stupid it sounds. Consider the Trojan horse, you can&#39;t bet &quot;through the front door&quot; was the most logical idea, but it worked!</p>
<p>Give credits to your unconscious brain, feed it with your past experience and don&#39;t underestimate the power of rubber ducking.</p>
<h3 id="47-working-together">47. Working Together</h3>
<p>Start with pair programming, it decreases the trivial approaches and dirty shortcuts, thus improves the quality. Also try mob programming, with those considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the code, not your ego. It&#39;s not about who is the brightest. We all had good and bad times.</li>
<li>Criticize the code, not the person.</li>
<li>Listen and try to understand others&#39; viewpoints, different is not wrong.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="48-the-essence-of-agility">48. The Essence of Agility</h3>
<p>The real agility is not following of some rules set on the stone. The true meaning is how you adapt it in your workflows in order to be responsive to change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Customer collaboration over contact negotiation</li>
<li>Responding tho change over following a plan</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping the feedback loop efficient, and iterating with small steps gives us the freedom of throwing away our work and starting over in order to reach the desired outcome.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9-pragmatic-projects">Chapter 9: Pragmatic Projects</h2>
<h3 id="49-pragmatic-teams">49. Pragmatic Teams</h3>
<p>Small, cross functional, mostly stable entity of its own, that considers the following items:</p>
<h4 id="no-broken-windows">No Broken Windows</h4>
<p>Teams as a whole should not tolerate broken windows and integrate it as a team practice, thus the newcomers will also adapt it.</p>
<h4 id="boiled-frogs">Boiled Frogs</h4>
<p>Encourage everyone to actively monitor the environment for changes. Stay awake and aware for increased scope.</p>
<h4 id="schedule-your-knowledge-portfolio">Schedule Your Knowledge Portfolio</h4>
<p>The team should work on more than just new features, it should be serious about improvement and innovation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Old systems maintenance</li>
<li>Process reflection and refinement</li>
<li>New tech experiments</li>
<li>Learning and skill improvements</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="communicate-team-presence">Communicate Team Presence</h4>
<p>Great project teams have a distinct personality. People look forward to meetings with them, because they know that they&#39;ll se a well-prepared performance that makes everyone feel good.</p>
<h4 id="know-when-to-stop-adding-paint">Know When to Stop Adding Paint</h4>
<p>Remember that teams are made of individuals, give each member the ability to shine in their own way. Give them just enough structure to support them and to ensure that the project delivers value.</p>
<h3 id="50-coconuts-dont-cut-it">50. Coconuts Don&#39;t Cut It</h3>
<p>Know your context, structure and organization before trying to adapt what everyone is doing, or whatever the most popular thing is. Don&#39;t hesitate to try things to see what works out for you.</p>
<p>The real goal should be decreasing the delivery time to be continuous, not years, not months, not weeks; hours.</p>
<h3 id="51-pragmatic-starter-kit">51. Pragmatic Starter Kit</h3>
<p>Covers the best practices around version control, continuous delivery, integration, unit testing and so on. One good takeaway from this chapter is; once you found and fix a bug, write tests for it so you make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again.</p>
<h3 id="52-delight-your-users">52. Delight Your Users</h3>
<p>Ask them how will they know what we&#39;ve all been successful a month (or a year, or whatever) after this project is done?</p>
<h3 id="53-pride-and-prejudice">53. Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t shirk from responsibility, rejoice in accepting challenges.</li>
<li>Minimize your ego, don&#39;t judge other people&#39;s work before you are into it.</li>
<li>Decrease anonymity to prevent sloppiness, mistakes, sloth and bad code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="postface">Postface</h2>
<p>As programmers, we have the power to build products which would shape the society. Keep your lights on and don&#39;t put your humanity into the second plan.</p>
<p>Ask the following questions to yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have I protected the user?</li>
<li>Would I use this myself?</li>
</ul>
<p>Recognize when you are doing something against the ideal, and have the courage to say <strong><em>&quot;no!&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p>Envision the future we <em>could</em> have, and have the courage to create it.</p>

<h3 id="difference-between-typeface-and-font">Difference between Typeface and Font</h3>
<p>A typeface is an abstract idea, a design that does not take any physical form, while a font is the physical manifestation of a typeface. Traditionally, different sizes were separate fonts; metal type could not be scaled, and you had to have each size in your printing inventory. If you have Times New Roman in 6pt metal, 12pt metal, and digital OpenType.</p>
<h3 id="screenplay-writing-and-typography">Screenplay writing and typography</h3>
<p>In screenplay writing, a general typography rule is to use 12pt Courier on Letter or A4 format. The idea is that a page should equal a minute of screen time if written in this format. This varies wildly in practice. For example, Tarantino&#39;s screenplays easily span several pages in a minute of screen time.</p>

<p>Should answer three questions: WHY, WHAT, HOW</p>
<h3 id="why">WHY</h3>
<p>There are two types of motivations: instrumental (learning it to find a new job) and intrinsic (learning it just because). Knowing that will also help you to determine HOW. Expert interviews would help if it’s more like an instrumental motivation.</p>
<h3 id="what">WHAT</h3>
<h4 id="concepts">Concepts</h4>
<p>Anything needs to be understood, not just memorized.</p>
<p><em>Example: Derivatives for Calculus</em></p>
<h4 id="facts">Facts</h4>
<p>Anything needs to be memorized. You don’t need to understand them deeply as long as you recall them in correct situations.</p>
<p><em>Example: Trigonometric identities in Calculus</em></p>
<h4 id="procedures">Procedures</h4>
<p>Anything needs to be practiced. They may not require deep understanding.</p>
<p><em>Example: Riding a bicycle</em></p>
<h3 id="how">HOW</h3>
<h4 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h4>
<ul>
<li>Finding the common ways in which people learn the skill or subject.</li>
<li>For academic stuff: MIT, Stanford, Harvard curriculums.</li>
<li>For softer stuff: Reddit</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="emphsize--exclude">Emphsize / Exclude</h4>
<ul>
<li>Derive the path of learning than modify it with respect to your needs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="research">Research</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is accurate to allocate 10 percent time of the learning process to the research.</li>
<li>It is not an hard requirement to do the research at the beginning, sometimes it helps to review the process made.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-law-of-diminishing-returns">The Law of Diminishing Returns</h4>
<ul>
<li>More time you invest in an activity (such as more research), the weaker and weaker the benefits will be as you get closer and closer to the ideal approach.</li>
<li>If you keep doing research, eventually it will be less valuable than simply doing more learning, so at that point you can safely focus on learning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="principle-2-focus">Principle 2: Focus</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Recognize where you are, try to start small</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="procascination">Procascination</h3>
<ul>
<li>To avoid it, try to develop awaraness first.</li>
<li>Why? -&gt; the task you actually want to do is harder so you want to delay it by doing easier stuff.</li>
<li>To solve it -&gt; try to start working on the actual task by convincing yourself for just 5 mins.</li>
<li>If you start slacking off after 5 mins, next step to try is POMODORO</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Try to set a schedule for your tasks (was also mentioned in <a href="https://altay.wtf/books/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>)</li>
<li>If your schedule is too tight, remember that you can always use 5 mins or Pomodoro</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sustaining-focus">Sustaining Focus</h3>

</ul>
<h2 id="principle-3-directness">Principle 3: Directness</h2>
<p>We want to speak a language but try to learn mostly by playing on fun apps, rather than conversing with actual people.</p>
<p>We want to work on collaborative, professional programs but mostly code scripts in isolation.</p>
<p>We want to become great speakers, so we buy a book on communication, rather than practice presenting.</p>
<p>In all these cases the problem is the same: directly learning the thing we want feels too uncomfortable, boring, or frustrating, so we settle for some book, lecture, or app, hoping it will eventually make us better at the real thing.</p>
<h3 id="story-of-vatsal-jaiswal">Story of Vatsal Jaiswal</h3>
<p>Moves to Canada from India, gets an architecture degree from a design school where they do more therotical education. Tries to get a job but gets rejected repeatedly. Decides to build his portfolio by focus on learning what is actually needed in the industry. Gets a job in a print center who serves mostly to the architecture offices. Studies the blueprints, learns a software by designing his own building.</p>
<p>During the MIT challange, the biggest problem was not to have no educational material, it’s not having any problem sets to study for the final.</p>
<p>The Transfer Problem (mostly on traditional education, it’s hard to use something you learn in classroom context in the real life context) is solved by directness in two ways</p>
<ul>
<li>You actually learn in the real context.</li>
<li>If you discover a trick while learning something in real life context, you can use that trick while learning other stuff as well. (using quick translator apps on your phone while trying to speak a new language) -&gt; this is a very powerfull side of our generation actually.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you learn something specific, you may still need to understand the concepts that it’s tied to in a broader way. If you want to master it, you need to keep going :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Based Learning</li>
<li>Immersive Learning: Surrounding yourself with the target environment which the skill is practised</li>
<li>Overkill Approach: Putting yourself in an environment which has higher demands than just possitive feedback :) Taking harder tests than your skill level.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="principle-4-drill">Principle 4: Drill</h2>
<p>It’s much more pleasant to spend time focusing on things you’re already good at. Teasing out the worst thing about your performance and practicing that in isolation takes guts. The difficulty and usefulness of drills repeat a pattern that will recur throughout the ultralearning principles: that something mentally strenuous provides a greater benefit to learning than something easy.</p>
<p>Example of Benjamin Franklin: chooses a topic (writing), divides it to sub-topics (structure, vocabulary, grammar) tries to achieve a level of confidance in one without worrying too much about the others (writing articles which has good layout but bad grammar) then starts drilling on next topic. Sub-takeaway: he tries to use Socratic method, avoiding “abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation,” instead focusing on being the “humble inquirer and doubter.”</p>
<p>In chemical reactions, there are rate-determining steps which affects the time required to complete the reaction significantly. In learning, your weakest point is the rate-determining step. If you drill on your weaker points, it’ll improve your overall competence and will help mastering every aspects of that skill.</p>
<h3 id="ultralearner-approach-direct-then-drill">Ultralearner approach: direct-then-drill</h3>
<ul>
<li>Practise the skill directly, craft something.</li>
<li>Analyze the skill and isolate the components, try to determine the rate-determining steps.</li>
<li>DRILL</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="designing-drills">Designing drills</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time slicing</li>
<li>Cognitive components</li>
<li>Copycat (take something and overwrite the part that you’re drilling)</li>
<li>Magnifying glass (spending more time on the drill that you wouldn’t normally)</li>
<li>Prerequiste chaining</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="principle-5-retrieval">Principle 5: Retrieval</h2>
<p>Trying to retrieve an answer that doesn’t yet exist in your mind is like laying down a road leading to a building that hasn’t been constructed yet. The destination doesn’t exist, but the path to get to where it will be, once constructed, is developed regardless.</p>
<h3 id="testing-experiment">Testing experiment</h3>
<p>Three groups of students have been told to study by</p>
<ul>
<li>passively reviewing the resources</li>
<li>test yourself (performed better)</li>
<li>create a diagram of main concepts</li>
</ul>
<p>When you review something passively, you don’t get any feedback about what you know and don’t know. Since tests usually come with feedback, that might explain why students who practiced self-testing beat the concept mappers or passive reviewers.</p>
<h3 id="what-should-be-retrieved">What should be retrieved?</h3>
<ul>
<li>formulas, implementation details..</li>
<li>having seen multiple ways to solve a problem is better than knowing one and being a master of the solution.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-practice">How to practice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flash cards</li>
<li>Free recall (Feynman Technique)</li>
<li>Self generated challanges</li>

<li><p>​Defining freedom in different ways (reducing expectations, increasing sources of income so no one source controls you).</p>
</li>
<li><p>​Improving relationships. Plus, minus, equal: Finding mentors to teach you. Finding the next generation to teach. Finding friends who build you up and challenge you. This is your “scene.” Everyone going through reinvention needs a scene.</p>
</li>
<li><p>​Habits. It’s the 5x5 rule. You are not just the average of the five people around you. You’re the average of the five habits you do, the things you eat, the ideas you have, the content you consume, etc.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An ontological secure person has his sense of the world, his identity and other beings in the world as an autonomous individual.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-existential-phenomenological-foundations-for-a-science-of-persons">The Existential-Phenomenological Foundations for A Science of Persons</h2>
<p>The term schizoid refers to an individual the totality of whose experience is split in two main ways: in the first place, there is a rent in his relation with his world and, in the second, there is a disruption of his relation with himself.</p>
<h3 id="key-step-of-analyzing-such-situation-like-this-is-to-consider-this-first">Key step of analyzing such situation like this is to consider this first:</h3>
<p>We all know from our personal experience that we can be ourselves only in and through our world and there is a sense in which ‘our’ world will die with us although ‘the’ world will go on without us.</p>
<p>So, experiencing your own life as a human being is a really important factor. We are concerned specifically with people who experience themselves as automata, robots, machinery or even as animals.</p>
<p>For cases like this, Doctor’s approach should be without prejudgement.</p>
<h2 id="the-existential-phenomenological-foundations-for-the-understanding-of-psychosis">The Existential-Phenomenological Foundations for the Understanding of Psychosis</h2>
<p>Psychiatrist should try to see behaviours of patients as expression of their existance rather then signs of a disease. They might be more than just some odd behaviour and lead to a better understanding.</p>
<h2 id="ontological-insecurity">Ontological Insecurity</h2>
<p>An ontological secure person has his sense of the world, his identity and other beings in the world as an autonomous individual.</p>
<p>If a position of primary ontological security has been reached, the ordinary circumstances of life do not afford a perpetual threat to one’s own existence. If such a basis for living has not been reached, the ordinary circumstances of everyday life constitute a continual and deadly threat.</p>
<p>Three forms of anxiety encountered by the ontologically insecure person:</p>
<h3 id="enfulgment">Enfulgment</h3>
<p>Engulfment is felt as a risk in being understood (thus grasped, comprehended), in being loved, or even simply in being seen. To be hated may be feared for other reasons, but to be hated as such is often less disturbing than to be destroyed, as it is felt, through being engulfed by love.</p>
<p>The main manoeuvre used to preserve identity under pressure from the dread of engulfment is isolation.</p>
<h3 id="implosion">Implosion</h3>
<p>The individual feels that he is empty and any contact with reality is a dreadful threat because it destroys his own being.</p>
<h3 id="petrification-and-depersonalization">Petrification and depersonalization</h3>
<p>A person may have come to anticipate that any possible relationship with another will have the latter consequences. Any other is then a threat to his ‘self’ (his capacity to act autonomously) not by reason of anything he or she may do or not do specifically, but by reason of his or her very existence.</p>

        <link href="https://altay.wtf/books/company-of-one"/>
        <updated>2019-01-20T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All you need is to be a decent human being with a valued skill set and a willingness to share what you know with people who’ll listen.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The book starts with Paul&#39;s moving story from Vancouver to Tofino, a small town:</p>
<p>Yet we soon learned that living in the woods on an island does something funny—it forces you to go deep within your own thoughts. There’s not a whole lot else you can do, especially if you don’t have a television or even Netflix. And at first, exploring your own thoughts is one of the scariest things in the world. (A study at the University of Virginia by Timothy Wilson found that people would rather get electric shocks than simply be alone with their thoughts.) But then again, if you sit with your thoughts for a while, they can reveal some mind-set-changing ideas.</p>
<p>In other words, by scaling down every aspect of my life, I realized this was how I had successfully built my business all along.</p>
<p>A company of one isn’t simply a practicing freelancer either. While freelancing is a perfect first step to becoming a company of one, freelancers are different because they exchange time for money. Whether they’re getting paid by the hour or by deliverables, if they’re not working, they’re not getting paid. All of a freelancer’s relationships are one-to-one, meaning that each time paid work occurs, a freelancer has to do something and use his or her time.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re utilizing systems, automations, and processes to build a long-term business, you’re not trading time for money, but instead operating and profiting outside of the time you spend working and beyond your one-to-one relationships.</strong></p>
<p>Just as Michael Pollan’s food ideology is summarized in three simple rules—“eat food, not too much, mostly plants”—the “company of one” model can be laid out in a similar fashion: “start small, define growth, and keep learning.”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-defining-company-of-one">Chapter 1: Defining Company of One</h2>
<p>A company of one is simply a business that questions growth.</p>
<p>I’ve personally see the most success in my life when I’ve figured out solutions to problems without having to do what traditional businesses do to solve problems—hire more people, throw more money at the problem, or build complex infrastructures to support the extra employees. Basically, I’m not interested in addressing problems by throwing “more” at them. Solving with “more” means more complexity, more costs, more responsibilities, and typically more expenses. <strong>More is generally the easiest answer, but not the smartest.</strong> I’ve found both delight and financial benefits in working out solutions to problems without growing. Instead, I and many others enjoy handling problems with the resources currently available. Although it can require a little more ingenuity, solving problems this way can set a business up for long-term stability, since less is needed to keep it afloat.</p>
<p>If you’re a company of one, your mind-set is to build your business around your life, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Four typical traits of all companies of one</p>
<h3 id="resilience">Resilience</h3>
<ul>
<li>Story of Daniele LaPorte (hired a CEO who decreased the role of her in her own company)</li>
<li>The first trait that resilient people have is an acceptance of reality.</li>
<li>The second characteristic of resilient people is a sense of purpose—being motivated by a sense of meaning rather than by just money.</li>
<li>The last trait of resilient people in a company of one is the ability to adapt when things change—because they invariably do.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="autonomy-and-control">Autonomy and Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>Being a company of one lets you control your own life and your job.</li>
<li>Kaitlin Maud, a freelance digital strategist thinks that a sense of autonomy looks different on everyone. She herself has created a work life that rewards her for getting her work done quickly. In a typical company, regardless of how quickly you work, you’re still required to be there for a set number of hours a day; in other words, there’s no reward for productivity or efficiency. Kaitlin has also found that she’s able to get work done with more focus from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM, so she doesn’t schedule meetings or calls during that window of time.</li>
<li><strong>Bear this in mind: achieving control over a company of one requires more than just using the core skill you are hired for. It also requires proficiency at sales, marketing, project management, and client retention. Whereas most normal corporate workers can be hyperfocused on a single skill, companies of one, even within a larger business, need to be generalists who are good at several things—often all at once.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Companies of one question their systems, processes, and structure to become more efficient and to achieve more with the same number of employees and fewer hours of work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start without automation or infrastructure or overhead. Start by helping one customer. Then another. This puts your focus on helping people immediately with what you’ve got available to you right now. Work on things like sales funnels and automation when it no longer makes sense to personalize your interactions with your customers in surprising and delightful ways.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-2-staying-small-as-an-end-goal">Chapter 2: Staying Small as an End Goal</h2>
<p>Whether your audience is ten people, a hundred people, or even a thousand people, if you’re not doing right by them, right now, nothing you do regarding growth or marketing will make a lick of difference. Make sure you’re listening to, communicating with, and helping the people who are already paying attention to you.</p>
<p>Part of Sean’s customer retention strategy involves sending his customers a box of chocolates, with a handwritten note and sometimes a small cartoon he draws himself. The package costs him approximately $20, which includes shipping from New Zealand (where he lives currently), but it’s the one thing his customers talk about. They’ll buy a $2,000 training program from him and talk about the chocolate. He’ll give a speech at an event, and people will talk about the chocolate. His customers love these small touches, and the attention his business gives them, because his company of one focuses solely on serving his existing customers, not on infinite growth.</p>
<p>When you hire employees, you’re responsible for them. You’re their source of income that goes toward paying their mortgages, feeding their families, and even sending their children to college. That’s a heavy responsibility.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-whats-required-to-lead">Chapter 3: What’s Required to Lead</h2>
<p>Introverted Leaders: a quieter, calmer leader is more likely to listen carefully, stay very focused, and not be afraid to work for long stretches of time without interruption. And they are able to lead a team of people who can do the same.</p>
<p><strong>Companies of one are sometimes quiet people who are internally motivated to make a difference in the world without shouting.</strong></p>
<p>Historian Henry Adams stated that power is a tumor that ends up killing its victims’ sympathies.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-growing-a-company-that-doesnt-grow">Chapter 4: Growing a Company That Doesn’t Grow</h2>
<p>Churn is what happens when existing customers decide they don’t want to be customers anymore. So the revenue they generated needs to be replaced with revenue from new customers. If your churn is higher than your user acquisition rate, then you’re in a downward spiral.</p>
<p>We often think that we need to have everything in place—all the systems, all the automations, all the processes—to be ready to launch a digital product. We want everything all polished and perfect before we hit “publish.” But most of the time this doesn’t happen. Most of the time, in fact, waiting until everything is totally perfect can only hurt or delay your launch.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5-determining-the-right-mind-set">Chapter 5: Determining the Right Mind-Set</h2>
<p>When you focus on solving problems or on making a difference, passion may follow, because you’re actually involved in the work you’re doing instead of just dreaming that you might be passionate about something.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6-personality-matters">Chapter 6: Personality Matters</h2>
<p>The best marketing is never just about selling a product or service, but about taking a stand—showing an audience why they should believe in what you’re marketing enough to want it at any cost, simply because they agree with what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>Guy Kawasaki believes, we should create products that make specifically identified groups of people very happy and ignore everyone else.</strong></p>
<h2 id="chapter-7-the-one-customer">Chapter 7: The One Customer</h2>
<p>You don’t get referrals by just meeting the standard expectations of customer service—people rarely find it worth mentioning to others that a company did just enough to help them but nothing more. You have to do much more than that to evangelize customers if you want them to talk about your company favorably. A great example is a now-infamous story from the tech world about a customer service call to RackSpace, an enterprise-level cloud hosting provider. The call center rep heard someone in the background of a support call mention that he was hungry and wonder about ordering something. She quietly put the customer on hold, ordered a pizza to be delivered to the address she had on file, and went back to assisting the customer with his problem. Twenty minutes later, still on the phone with the customer, she heard a knock in the background and told him to go answer the door, saying, “It’s your pizza.” The pleasant unexpected experience led to not only a very happy (and full) customer but also a story that would be shared thousands of times online. This is the kind of customer service that builds reciprocity: your customer gets something unexpected and then feels the need to help your business, not only by remaining loyal but also by telling others.</p>
<p>If you find that support requests are primarily on a certain topic, maybe you could do a better job of teaching users about that topic. And if a handful of requests on a certain topic continue to come up again and again, perhaps that topic can be the basis of your next user-led innovation initiative.</p>
<p>You have to own your mistakes—even those caused by someone else—by taking personal responsibility for them before someone else blames you for them. The first step is apologizing like a real, empathetic human, not a corporate PR-sounding robot.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment of fault is powerful. It shows empathy, a willingness to own the problem, and a desire to then fix it. And as the studies cited here all found, apologizing effectively can cost dramatically less than a lawsuit or a refund.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-8-scalable-systems">Chapter 8: Scalable Systems</h2>
<p>Real-time collaboration can be very useful when a whole team is required to brainstorm or solve a problem together, but it can also be completely distracting if it’s expected most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9-teach-everything-you-know">Chapter 9: Teach Everything You Know</h2>
<p>Lawyer Brian: freely sharing information with them on a weekly basis proved fruitful: because he was writing educational content, people trusted his expertise and then wanted to hire, not just any lawyer, but the person who was sharing the information they needed.</p>
<p>Ideas alone are worthless, execution is the only valid currency in business.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to just tell people you’re an authority—you’ve got to demonstrate your actual expertise by sharing what you know and teaching others. Creating a relationship with an audience that sees you as a teacher sets you up to be perceived as the domain expert on the subject matter.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-10-properly-utilizing-trust-and-scale">Chapter 10: Properly Utilizing Trust and Scale</h2>
<p><strong>Trust by Proxy:</strong> According to Nielsen, 92 percent of consumers trust recommendations from family or friends over any other form of advertising.</p>
<p>If you ask for a testimonial as soon as a project is finished, the client has rarely had enough time to collect any results-based data. By creating a schedule for following up with contented clients, you can turn referrals into a real strategy instead of simply refreshing your inbox and hoping each day that one will come in.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-11-launching-and-iterating-in-tiny-steps">Chapter 11: Launching and Iterating in Tiny Steps</h2>
<p>Minimum Viable Profit</p>
<p>If you’re overvaluing your plan because it’s your plan (known as the “endowment effect”), then you should probably quit.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-12-the-hidden-value-of-relationships">Chapter 12: The Hidden Value of Relationships</h2>
<p>If you’re focusing on growth, growth is what will happen . But if you focus instead on relationships that turn into long - term customers and sales , that’s what will happen instead .</p>
<h2 id="chapter-13-starting-a-company-of-onemy-story">Chapter 13: Starting a Company of One—My Story</h2>
<p>All you need is to be a decent human being with a valued skill set and a willingness to share what you know with people who’ll listen.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction: Story of James</strong></p>
<p>Tells about baseball bat accident that happened to him in high school and had to taken to a hospital with a helicopter and stayed in coma for a few days and serious injuries including one of his eyeball popping up because of the stuffed nose thing. However, he bounced back from this and made great success at university.</p>
<h3 id="british-cycling-teams-success-after-dave-brailsford">British cycling team’s success after Dave Brailsford</h3>
<p>The performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using their gear.</p>
<h3 id="why-small-habits-make-big-differences">Why small habits make big differences</h3>
<p>If you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.</p>
<p>The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York.</p>
<h3 id="what-progress-is-really-like">What progress is really like</h3>
<p>Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees.</p>
<p>When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success.</p>
<h2 id="goals-vs-systems">Goals vs Systems</h2>
<ul>
<li>Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.</li>
<li>In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.”</li>
<li>Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals</li>
<li>Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.</li>
<li>Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.</li>
<li>Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.</li>
<li><strong>When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-habits-shape-the-identity">How Habits Shape the Identity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.</strong></li>
<li>This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.</li>
<li>You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.</li>
<li>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two step process of changing your identity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide the type of person you want to be.</li>
<li>Prove it to yourself with small wins.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-1st-law-make-it-obvious">The 1st Law: Make it Obvious</h2>
<ul>
<li>Habits scorecard: the goal is to simply notice what is actually going on.</li>
<li>Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal criticism. Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for your successes.</li>
<li>The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in your own life.</li>
<li>Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be. If you want to cut back on your junk food habit but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud, “I’m about to eat this cookie, but I don’t need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="best-way-to-start-a-new-habbit">Best Way to Start a New Habbit</h3>
<p><strong>Implementation Intention</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].”</li>
<li>The punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Habit Stacking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diderot’s daughter was about to married but he didn’t have money. He sold his personal library to a Russian princess and earned a lot of money. He afforded the wedding and bought a new robe with himself. But that robe was so beautiful so he had to change his whole belongings to match with that robe :D His behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect.</li>
<li>The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="motivation-is-overrated-environment-often-matters-more">Motivation is Overrated, Environment Often Matters More</h3>
<p>It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.</p>
<h3 id="the-secret-to-self-control">The Secret to Self-Control</h3>
<p>Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.</p>
<p>Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.</p>
<h2 id="the-2nd-law-make-it-attractive">The 2nd Law: Make it Attractive</h2>
<ul>
<li>After spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.</li>
<li>Researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting.19 Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during liking.</li>
<li>Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="role-of-family-and-friends">Role of Family and Friends</h3>
<p><strong>Laszlo Polgar and his chess master daughters :D</strong></p>
<p>Once, Laszlo reportedly found Sofia playing chess in the bathroom in the middle of the night. Encouraging her to go back to sleep, he said, “Sofia, leave the pieces alone!” To which she replied, “Daddy, they won’t leave me alone!”</p>
<p><strong>Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together.</strong></p>
<p>To make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one step further. Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-find-and-fix-the-causes-of-your-bad-habits">How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.</li>
<li>Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to feel differently than you do in the moment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-3rd-law-make-it-easy----the-law-of-least-effort">The 3rd Law: Make it Easy -- The Law of Least Effort</h2>
<p>Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-stop-procascinating-by-using-the-two-minute-rule">How to Stop Procascinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule</h3>
<ul>
<li>A women calls cab before going to gym every morning, from that point there’s no going back :)</li>
<li>Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not the gym.</li>
<li>The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.</li>
<li>“When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”</li>
<li>Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-make-good-habits-inevitable--bad-habits-impossible">How to Make Good Habits Inevitable / Bad Habits Impossible</h3>
<ul>
<li>Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.</li>
<li>Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.</li>
<li>Within the first week of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’t need to check it nearly as often as I had been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day. It had simply been so easy that it had become the default.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-4th-law-make-it-satisfying">The 4th Law: Make it Satisfying</h2>
<p><strong>Better foamy soap story in Africa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once you understand how the brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it reduces stress and eases your nicotine cravings now.</li>
<li>Overeating is harmful in the long run but appetizing in the moment.</li>
<li>Sex—safe or not—provides pleasure right away. Disease and infection won’t show up for days or weeks, even years</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-stick-with-good-habits-every-day">How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day</h2>
<p>Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity. Visual measurement comes in many forms: food journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software download, even the page numbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker</p>
<p><strong>Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the process rather than the result.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Missing once is an accident.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Missing twice is the start of a new habit.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-an-accountability-partner-can-change-everything">How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything</h3>
<p><strong>To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them painful in the moment.</strong></p>
<p>You can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an entrepreneur in Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning.7 And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t malfunction.”</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Tactics, The Truth About Talent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore.</li>
<li>In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent.</li>
<li>When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-goldilocks-rule">The Goldilocks Rule</h3>
<ul>
<li>The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.</li>
<li>Humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-downside-of-creating-habits">The Downside of Creating Habits</h3>
<p>When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better. The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting better because you’re gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habits—not improving them. In fact, some research has shown that once a skill has been mastered there is usually a slight decline in performance over time.</p>

<li>First, it tells you to mind your own business and not decide what is “good” for others. We know with much more clarity what is bad than what is good.</li>
<li>There is a difference between a charlatan and a genuinely skilled member of society, say that between a macrobullshitter political “scientist” and a plumber, or between a journalist and a mafia made man. The doer wins by doing, not convincing.</li>

<p>There are two types of “talking one’s book.” One consists of buying a stock because you like it, then commenting on it (and disclosing such ownership)—the most reliable advocate for a product is its user.fn6 Another is buying a stock so you can advertise the qualities of the company, then selling it, benefiting from the trumpeting—this is called market manipulation, and it is certainly a conflict of interest.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-copenhagen-interpretation">The Copenhagen Interpretation</h2>
<p>Essential randomness of quantum measurement and philosophical problems raised by that.</p>
<h3 id="central-principles-of-quantum-mechanics">Central Principles of Quantum Mechanics</h3>
<h4 id="wavefunction">Wavefunction</h4>
<p>Every object or system of objects in the universe is described by a wavefunction, a mathematical function that has some value at every point in space. It doesn’t matter what you’re describing—an electron, a dog treat, a cat in a box—it has a wavefunction, and that wave-function has some value no matter where you look.</p>
<p>Schrodinger Equation governs the behaviour of wave functions.</p>
<h4 id="allowed-states">Allowed States</h4>
<p>A quantum object can only be observed in one of a limited number of allowed states.</p>
<h4 id="probability">Probability</h4>
<p>The wavefunction of an object determines the probability of being found in each of the allowed states.<br>By creating different scenarios for a case, you’ll have a wavefunction and it’ll lead you to that probability.</p>
<h4 id="measurement">Measurement</h4>
<p>Measuring the state of an object absolutely determines the state of that object.</p>
<h3 id="superposition-and-polarization">Superposition and Polarization</h3>
<p>Superposition is having the probability of existing in two different positions (double slit experiment)</p>
<p>Polarization of Light allows us to filter light and absorbe at some point in an experiment setup. It’s like marking the photons so we will know what happen at that step of the experiment, thus the measurement principle is changed. When we measure the polarization using a filter, we will find the photon in one of those two states (either passing through the vertical filter, or being absorbed by it), and not anywhere in between.</p>
<p>Polarized photons thus provide an excellent system for looking at the core principles of quantum mechanics. Each individual photon can be described in terms of a wavefunction, with two parts corresponding to the two allowed states, horizontal and vertical polarization. That wavefunction gives you the probability of the photon passing through a polarizing filter, and after you make a measurement of the polarization with a filter, the photons are in only one of the allowed states. A single photon passing through a polarizing filter demonstrates all the essential features of quantum physics. As a result, polarized photons have been used in many experiments demonstrating quantum phenomena.</p>
<h4 id="quantum-eraser">Quantum Eraser</h4>
<p>Double slit experiment creates an interference pattern which indicates the superposition state. When we block one slit, we know where that photon is going to end up but we don’t know when we have two slits.</p>
<p>Each individual photon is random but when we repeat the experiment, we end up with the interference pattern.</p>
<h4 id="copenhagen-interpretation">Copenhagen Interpretation</h4>
<p>Tries to avoid the problems of superposition and measurement by drawing a strict line between microscopic and macroscopic physics.</p>
<p>Werner Heisenberg insisted quite strongly that it was a mistake to talk about electrons having an independent reality. In his view, the only things we can really talk about are the outcomes of specific measurements. He rejected the whole notion of talking about what the electrons were doing between measurements.</p>
<p>Also seems to be saying that physical reality does not exist until a measurement is made, which poses its own philosophical problems: Scrodinger’s Cat and Wigner’s Friend</p>
<h2 id="many-worlds-interpretation">Many Worlds Interpretation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Interference -&gt; coherence -&gt; decoherence</li>
<li>we have little perception so we couldnt keep up with all of the states of an object and derive wave functions for those superpositions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-eOhdxbes">Mach-Zenhder Interferometer</a></li>
<li>The reason there is no mathematical method to describe the collapse of the wavefunction, Everett said, is because there is no such thing as the collapse of the wavefunction. Wavefunction is raising exponentially because you cannot separate observer from the measurement.</li>
<li>Decoherence is the result of random, fluctuating interactions with a larger environment, which destroy the possibility of interference between different branches of the wave-function, and make the world we experience look classical.</li>
<li>“Coherence” is a slippery word, but when we say that two wavefunctions are “coherent,” we mean that they behave as if they came from a single source.*</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quantum-zeno-effect">Quantum Zeno Effect</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you have a system that’s moving from one state to another, with the probability of being in the second state increasing over time, you can prevent the state change by repeated measurements. Every time you measure it to be in the first state, you restart the process.”</li>
<li>Quantom Interrogation: Optically detecting objects without any photons hitting it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quantum-tunnelling">Quantum Tunnelling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes a quantum particle can pass through the barrier and continue it’s way with the same energy in a completely random way.</li>
<li>The probability of a particle tunneling through a barrier depends on the thickness of the barrier and the quantum wavelength of the particle.</li>
<li>The probability of tunneling decreases exponentially as the barrier thickness increases—if you double the thickness, the probability is much less than half of the original probability.</li>
<li>This behaviour is a consequence of wave nature of matter.</li>
<li>Kinetic and Potential energy also discussed in this chapter.</li>
<li>Tunnelling is the basis of a device called Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) and it’s used for manufacturing particles.</li>
<li>The fusion reaction in the core of the Sun (sticking protons together to make Helium from Hydrogen) is also explained by tunneling. Those protons are repelling each other which creates a barrier and they don’t have enough energy to pass through that but TUNNELLING occurs.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="quantum-entanglement">Quantum Entanglement</h2>
<ul>
<li>We can measure a particle by just measuring it’s quantum entangled particle.</li>
<li>I have two treats in my hand, one chickend and one beef. If I give you the beef you’d knew that the other dog got the chicken. wtf?</li>
<li>Einstein says it’s impossible to do that measurement without sharing messages between measured particles but he thinks a little bit classical here because measuring a particle also changes the state of it’s entangled one. Entangled particles act like single object.</li>
<li>Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen prepared EPR paradox</li>
<li>Bells Theorem explained all?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quantum-teleportation">Quantum Teleportation</h2>
<ul>
<li>not exactly moving something from somewhere, more like transfering the state from a particle to another one</li>
<li>no-cloning theorem: it is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown quantum state.</li>
<li>quantum entanglement is used to hack no-cloning theorem.</li>
<li>we share a pair of entangled photons. I have another photon and make a measurement with my pair of entangled photon and tell you to adjust your entangled photon with respect to the measurement. but I still dont understand the table</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quantum-electrodynamics">Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
<ul>
<li>zero point energy: no quantum particle can ever be completely in rest but will always have some energy.</li>
<li>there are some virtual particles appear and disappear (anti particles) beacuse of that.</li>
<li>energy time uncertainity: if we make lots of experiments to have better samples about energy but we cant’t say WHEN EXACTLY we measured it and we loose the energy accuracy on the counter case.</li>
<li>E=mc2 -&gt; mass uncertainity</li>
<li>Feynman Diagrams and QED</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="misuses-of-quantum-physics">Misuses of Quantum Physics</h2>
<p>Some scammers claim they can</p>
<ul>
<li>suck the zero point energy from some materials and generate large amount of energy</li>
<li>do some distant healing with quantum entanglement</li>
<li>make you feel healty by quantum zeno effect :D</li>
<li>share your ideas with other people by quantum teleportation lol</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Seventy-nine percent of smartphone owners check their device within fifteen minutes of waking up every morning. 🤡</p>
<p>Cognitive psychologists define habits as <em>automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues</em>, things we do with little or no conscious thought.</p>
<h2 id="the-habit-zone">The Habit Zone</h2>
<p>Warren Buffett once said, &quot;You can determine the strength of a business over time by the amount of agony they go through in raising prices.&quot; Buffett and Munger understand that habits give companies greater flexibility to increase prices.</p>
<p>Viral Cycle Time is the amount of time it takes a user to invite another user, and it can have a massive impact.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs fall into the trap of building products that are only marginally better than existing solutions, hoping their innovation will be good enough to woo customers away from existing products. When it comes to shaking consumers’ old habits, these naive entrepreneurs often find that better products don’t always win—especially if a large number of users have already adopted a competing product.</p>
<h2 id="trigger">Trigger</h2>
<h3 id="external-triggers">External triggers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paid (advertising)</li>
<li>Earned (virality)</li>
<li>Relationship (friend advice)</li>
<li>Owned (app icon on home screen)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet external triggers are only the first step. The ultimate goal of all external triggers is to propel users into and through the Hook Model so that, after successive cycles, they do not need further prompting from external triggers. When users form habits, they are cued by a different kind of trigger: internal ones.</p>
<h3 id="internal-triggers">Internal triggers</h3>
<p>When a product becomes tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a preexisting routine, it leverages an internal trigger.</p>
<p>Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers and greatly influence our daily routines.</p>
<p>Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation.</p>
<h2 id="action">Action</h2>
<p>The trigger, driven by internal or external cues, informs the user of what to do next; however, if the user does not take action, the trigger is useless. To initiate action, doing must be easier than thinking.</p>
<p>Dr. B. J. Fogg, Director of the Persuasive Technology Lab of Stanford University has a behavior model for actions.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>User must have sufficient motivation. Fogg states that all humans are motivated to seek pleasure and avoid pain; to seek hope and avoid fear; and finally, to seek social acceptance and avoid rejection.</p>
<h3 id="ability">Ability</h3>
<p>User must have the ability to complete the action. Simplifying the steps for taking an action is important.</p>
<h3 id="trigger-1">Trigger</h3>
<p>A trigger must be present to activate the behavior.</p>
<h2 id="variable-reward">Variable Reward</h2>
<ul>
<li>Making reward variable increases the craving.</li>
<li>Skinner’s Box</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rewards-of-the-tribe">Rewards of the Tribe</h3>
<p>The search for social rewards fueled by connectedness with other people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking out facebook and liking your friends’ photos</li>
<li>Answering questions on stackoverflow for contributing the community</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rewards-of-the-hunt">Rewards of the Hunt</h3>
<p>The search for material resources and information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine gambling (especially slot machines)</li>
<li>Checking Twitter feed and hunting for the information</li>
<li>Infinite scrolling on Pinterest</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rewards-of-the-self">Rewards of the Self</h3>
<p>The search for intrinsic rewards of mastery, competence, and completion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing video games, levelling up, earning items, slaying <em>unslayable</em> bosses</li>
<li>Checking e-mail to feel <em>important</em> and look for new things</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="investment">Investment</h2>
<ul>
<li>More users invest time and effort into a product or service, the more they value it.</li>
<li>Documents, bookmarks, followers, likes, tinder matches, spotify playlists, lastfm listen counts...</li>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Observation, reason, and experiment make up what we call the scientific method.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because we know that we do not know all the laws as yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected.</p>
<h2 id="atoms-in-motion">Atoms in Motion</h2>
<p>All things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.</p>
<p>When we compress a gas slowly, the temperature of the gas increases. So, under slow compression, a gas will increase in temperature, and under slow expansion it will decrease in temperature.</p>
<p>If we blow on the water so as to maintain a continuous preponderance in the number evaporating, then the water is cooled. Hence, blow on soup to cool it! since those that leave have more energy than the average, the ones that are left have less average motion than they had before. So the liquid gradually cools if it evaporates.</p>
<h2 id="basic-physics">Basic Physics</h2>
<p>Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this multitude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an infinite variety of combinations.</p>
<p>Observation, reason, and experiment make up what we call the scientific method.</p>
<h2 id="relation-of-physics-to-other-sciences">Relation of Physics to Other Sciences</h2>
<p>The central problem of the mind, if you will, or the nervous system, is this: when an animal learns something, it can do something different than it could before, and its brain cell must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms.</p>
<p>In what way is it different?</p>
<p>We do not know where to look, or what to look for, when something is memorized.</p>
<p>We do not know what it means, or what change there is in the nervous system, when a fact is learned. This is a very important problem which has not been solved at all.</p>
<h2 id="conversation-of-energy">Conversation of Energy</h2>
<ul>
<li>gravitational potential energy</li>
<li>kinetic energy</li>
<li>elastic energy</li>
<li>heat energy</li>
<li>electrical energy</li>
<li>chemical energy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theory-of-gravitation">Theory of Gravitation</h2>
<p>What is this law of gravitation? It is that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force which for any two bodies is proportional to the mass of each and varies inversely as the square of the distance between them.</p>
<h3 id="keplers-laws">Kepler’s Laws</h3>
<p>First of all, Kepler found that each planet goes around the sun in a curve called an ellipse, with the sun at a focus of the ellipse.</p>
<p>Kepler’s second observation was that the planets do not go around the sun at a uniform speed, but move faster when they are nearer the sun and more slowly when they are farther from the sun</p>
<h2 id="quantum-behavior">Quantum Behavior</h2>
<p>“Quantum mechanics” is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale.</p>
<p>Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about.</p>
<p>They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen.</p>

<h2 id="economic-history-of-the-choose-yourself-era">Economic History of the Choose Yourself Era</h2>
<p>Old corporate area is in the past and you need to reconstruct your current standards with a more individualistic shape (not selfish)</p>
<p>Human beings are born pioneers, the rise of corporatism forced people to into cubicles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you wondered why the stock market didn’t just keep going down (after 2008 crysis). Because I moved to Wall Street in early March 2009.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...So I did the only thing I could do: I woke up early one morning in early March and bought a bag of chocolates. Small Hershey’s chocolates, like you hand out on Halloween. At around 8 a.m., I stood outside the entrance of the New York Stock Exchange and started handing out chocolates to everyone walking inside. People would be staring at their feet like zombies as they walked in, but 100 percent of the time, they would stop, look up, take the chocolate, and they would smile.</p>

<h2 id="permanently-temporary">Permanently Temporary</h2>
<p>If you are doing a shitty job you’re a temp. guy forever? Sorry for the rudeness but it’s like that, like Naval always says. if you’re doing something trainable, they’ll make you train another person and replace you.</p>
<p>In every single industry, the middleman is being taken out of the picture, causing more disruption in employment but also greater efficiencies and more opportunities for unique ideas to generate real wealth.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-choose-yourself">How to Choose Yourself?</h2>
<h3 id="only-do-things-you-enjoy">Only Do Things You Enjoy</h3>
<p>Only think about the people you enjoy. Only read the books you enjoy, that make you happy to be human. Only go to the events that actually make you laugh or fall in love. Only deal with the people who love you back, who are winners and want you to win too.</p>
<p>Every time you say yes to something you don’t want, your fire starts to go away.</p>
<p>You need to implement a daily practise which aims to gain better physical, emotional, mental, spritual health.</p>
<h3 id="physical-body">Physical Body</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get up early.</li>
<li>Walk!</li>
<li>Eat healthy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="emotional-body">Emotional Body</h3>
<h4 id="about-annoying-people">About annoying people</h4>
<p>Acknowledge that the person is driving you crazy. You can’t suppress that. But with observation, the pain will begin to wither. <strong>And the less you engage with the person, the less overall effect that person will have on you.</strong></p>
<p>You can’t be beautiful unless you get rid of the ugliness inside.</p>
<h4 id="try-to-be-quiet">Try to be quiet</h4>
<p>Instead of speaking the average 2,500 words a day that most people speak, it would be nice for me to speak just one thousand words a day when possible. This forces me to carefully choose my words and who I engage with.</p>
<h3 id="mental-body">Mental Body</h3>
<p>Tire your brain</p>
<h3 id="spiritual-body">Spiritual Body</h3>
<p>When you surrender and accept the beautiful stillness around you, when you give up all thoughts of the past, all worries and anxieties of the future, when you surround yourself with similarly positive people, when you tame the mind, when you keep healthy, there is zero chance of burnout.</p>
<p>When you catch yourself upset about the past or worried about the future , say to yourself , “ Ah , I’m time traveling , ” then STOP . That’s what meditation is .</p>
<h3 id="simple-daily-practice">Simple Daily Practice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sleep eight hours.</li>
<li>Eat two meals instead of three.</li>
<li>No TV.</li>
<li>No junk food.</li>
<li>No complaining for one whole day.</li>
<li>No gossip.</li>
<li>Return an e-mail from five years ago.</li>
<li>Express thanks to a friend.</li>
<li>Watch a funny movie or a stand-up comic.</li>
<li>Write down a list of ideas. The ideas can be about anything.</li>
<li>Read a spiritual text. Any one that is inspirational to you. The Bible, The Tao te Ching, anything you want.</li>
<li>Say to yourself when you wake up, “I’m going to save a life today.” Keep an eye out for that life you can save.</li>
<li>Take up a hobby. Don’t say you don’t have time.</li>
<li>Write down your entire schedule. The schedule you do every day. Cross out one item and don’t do that anymore.</li>
<li>Surprise someone.</li>
<li>Think of ten people you are grateful for.</li>
<li>Forgive someone. You don’t have to tell them. Just write it down on a piece of paper and burn the paper. It turns out this has the same effect in terms of releasing oxytocin in the brain as actually forgiving them in person.</li>
<li>Take the stairs instead of the elevator.</li>
<li>Read a chapter in a biography about someone who is an inspiration to you.</li>

<p>In an interview with Forbes she (Sara Blakely) said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like money makes you more of who you already are. If you’re an asshole, you become a bigger asshole. If you’re nice, you become nicer. Money is fun to make, fun to spend, and fun to give away.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="becoming-an-idea-machine">Becoming an Idea Machine</h3>
<p>An idea is too big if you can’t think of the next step.<br>Every day, read/skim chapters from books on at least four different topics.</p>
<h3 id="dont-have-opinions">Don’t Have Opinions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m trying to eliminate things. Not just material belongings I no longer need or never really needed to begin with, but all those things we’ve been taught from birth are “important” or “our way of life” that have actually become burdens and wastes of time because we cling to them and protect them like they are more precious than the time and energy we waste protecting them.</p>
